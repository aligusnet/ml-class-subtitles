1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,190
In this video, I'd like to

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,380
show you a fun and historically

3
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:06,710
important example of Neural Network Learning.

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,860
Of using a Neural Network for autonomous driving

5
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,800
that is getting a car to learn to drive itself.

6
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:15,120
The video that I

7
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,810
showed a minute, was something

8
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:18,460
that I've gotten from Dean Pomilieu,

9
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,250
who Colleague who works

10
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,130
out in Carnegie Mellon University out

11
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,450
on the east coast of the United States,

12
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:25,340
and in part of the

13
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,220
video you see visualizations like

14
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,070
this, and what I should tell you what the visualization

15
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,250
looks like before starting to

16
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,160
video.

Down here

17
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,090
on the lower left is the

18
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,740
view seen by the car

19
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:37,830
of what's in front of it

20
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,120
and so here you know, you will kind

21
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,440
of see you know, a road that's

22
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:41,460
maybe going a bit to

23
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:42,660
the left and going a little bit to

24
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:45,240
the right, and up

25
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,810
here on top, this

26
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,930
first horizontal bar shows the

27
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,740
direction selected by the

28
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,570
human driver and is the

29
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,170
location of this bright

30
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,090
white band that shows the

31
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,680
steering direction selected by the

32
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:00,670
human driver, where, you

33
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:02,140
know, here, far to the left

34
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:03,900
corresponds to steering hard left;

35
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:05,440
here corresponds to steering hard

36
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:06,970
to the right; and so

37
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,490
this location, which is a

38
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,710
little bit to the left,

39
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,880
a little bit left of

40
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,270
center, means that the human

41
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,510
driver, at this point, was

42
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,010
steering slightly to the left. 

A

43
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,870
nd this second part here

44
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,130
corresponds to the steering

45
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,860
direction selected by the

46
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:22,100
learning algorithm; and again, the

47
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:23,300
location of this sort

48
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,840
of white band, means the

49
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:27,030
neural network was here, selecting

50
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,370
a steering direction just slightly to

51
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,960
the left and in fact,

52
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:31,380
before the neural network starts

53
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:33,160
learning initially, you

54
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:35,160
see that the network outputs a

55
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:36,570
grey band, like a

56
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,880
grey uniform, grey band throughout

57
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,730
this region, so the uniform

58
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,320
grey fuzz corresponds to the

59
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:44,440
neural network having been randomly

60
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:46,500
initialized, and initially having

61
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:48,010
no idea how to

62
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,040
drive the car, or initially having

63
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:52,580
no idea what direction to steer in.

64
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,850
And it's only after it's learned

65
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,690
for a while that it will then start

66
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,760
to output like a solid white

67
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:58,790
band in just a small

68
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,690
part of the region corresponding

69
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,950
to choosing a particular steering direction.

70
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,330
And that corresponds to when a neural network.

71
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,070
Becomes more confident in selecting, you know,

72
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,210
a and in one

73
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,910
location rather than outputting

74
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,290
a sort of light gray

75
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,960
fuzz, but instead outputting

76
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,400
a white band that's

77
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:20,720
more constantly selecting one steering direction.

78
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,330
Alban is a system

79
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,270
of artificial neural networks, that learns to steer

80
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,580
by watching a person drive. Alban

81
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,660
is designed to control the

82
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,910
tube a modified army

83
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,010
Humvee who could put

84
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,150
sensors, computers and actuators

85
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,300
for autonomous navigation experiments.

86
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,740
The initial spec in

87
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,230
configuring Alban is training in

88
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,570
the training the person drives

89
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:52,140
to be a car while Alban watches.

90
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:58,680
Once every two seconds, Alban

91
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,310
digitizes a video image

92
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:04,760
of the road ahead, and records the person's steering direction.

93
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,550
This training image is reduced

94
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,460
in resolution to 30 by

95
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,580
32 pixels and provided

96
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:20,600
as input to Alban's three-layer

97
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,450
network.

98
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:25,360
Using the back propagation learning algorithm; Alban

99
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,930
is training to output the same

100
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,520
steering direction as the

101
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:31,470
human driver for that image

102
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:37,470
Initially, the network's steering response is random.

103
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,090
After about two minutes of

104
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,070
training, the network learns

105
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,100
to accurately imitate the steering

106
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:57,930
reactions of the

107
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:03,700
human driver. This same

108
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:07,940
training procedure is repeated for other road types.

109
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,760
After the networks have been trained the

110
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:13,190
operator pushes the run

111
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,040
switch and often begins

112
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:20,860
driving. 12 times

113
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:23,080
per second, Alban digitizes an

114
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:26,630
image and feeds it to its neural networks.

115
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:35,920
Each network, running in parallel,

116
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:39,640
produces a steering direction and a measure of it's

117
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,550
confidence in its response.

118
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:50,130
The steering direction

119
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,330
from the most confident network.

120
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,990
In this case, the network trained

121
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,140
for the one-lane road is used to control the vehicle.

122
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,300
Suddenly, an intersection appears ahead

123
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:10,850
of the vehicle.

124
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,670
As the vehicle approaches the intersection,

125
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,240
the confidence of the one-lane network decreases.

126
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:40,120
As it crosses the intersection, and

127
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,430
the two-lane road ahead comes

128
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,110
into view, the confidence of the two-lane network rises.

129
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,410
When it's confidence rises, the two-lane

130
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,040
network is selected to steer,

131
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,370
safely guiding the vehicle

132
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:00,530
into it's lane, on the two-lane road.

133
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,000
So that was autonomous

134
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:10,140
driving using a neural network. Of course, there are more

135
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,900
recently more modern attempts

136
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:14,170
to do autonomous driving in a few properties, in

137
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,260
the U.S., in Europe, and so on.

138
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:18,390
They're giving more robust driving

139
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,070
controllers than this, but I

140
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,030
think it's still pretty remarkable and

141
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,680
pretty amazing how a simple

142
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:26,130
neural network trained with back-propagation

143
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:30,490
can, you know, actually learn to drive a car somewhat well.
