1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:03,010
In this video, this dug deeper

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:06,720
and get even better intuition about what the cost function is doing.

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:10,440
This video is to use that you're familiar with conswell plots.

4
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:12,150
If you're not familiar with contour

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,610
plots or contour figures, some

6
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:15,980
of the illustrations in this

7
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,810
video may or may not make sense to you.

8
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,420
But it's okay, and if

9
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:20,790
you end up skipping this video, or

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,300
if some of it doesn't quite make

11
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:24,350
sense because you haven't seen contour

12
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,870
before, that's okay and

13
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,090
you still understand the rest

14
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:30,240
of this clause without those parts of it.

15
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,830
Here's our problem formulation as

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,920
usual with the hypothesis, parameters,

17
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:40,060
cost function and our optimization objective.

18
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:41,860
I like a four and like

19
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:43,490
the last video, I'm going to

20
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,670
keep both of my parent's

21
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,030
theta 0 and theta

22
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:50,450
1 as we generate our visualizations for the cost function.

23
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,700
So, same as last time,

24
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:53,750
we went on the stand, the

25
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,920
hypothesis h and the

26
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,750
cost function j. So, here's

27
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,230
my training set of Housing prices

28
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,150
and let's pick some hypothesis,

29
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,410
you know, like that one.

30
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:05,700
This is not a particularly good

31
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:07,660
hypothesis, but if I

32
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:10,310
set theta 0 equals 50

33
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,810
and theta 1 equals 0.06,

34
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,270
then I end up

35
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,330
with this hypothesis down here,

36
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,210
and that corresponds to that straight line.

37
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:20,500
Now, given these values of

38
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:22,160
theta 0 and theta 1, we

39
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:24,090
want to plot the corresponding,

40
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:27,030
you know, cost function on the right.

41
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,000
What we did last time was,

42
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:30,600
when we only have theta

43
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:32,240
1, you know, we were drawing

44
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,940
plots that look like this as a function of theta 1.

45
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,260
But now we have two

46
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:37,850
parameters, theta 0 and

47
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,350
theta 1 and so the

48
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,770
plot gets a little more complicated.

49
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,090
It turns out that when we

50
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,810
had only one parameter that the

51
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:48,280
plots we drew had this sort of bow-shaped function.

52
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,130
Now when we have two

53
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,490
parameters, it turns out the

54
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,570
cost function also has a

55
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,870
similar sort of bow shape and

56
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,710
in fact, depending on your

57
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,790
training set, you might get a

58
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,000
cost function that maybe looks

59
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:01,270
something like this so this

60
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,750
is a 3D surface plot

61
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,280
where the axes are labeled

62
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:09,700
theta zero and theta one.

63
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,320
So, as you vary theta

64
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:12,660
0 and theta 1, the 2

65
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,260
parameters, you get different

66
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,770
values of the cost function,

67
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,100
j of theta 0, of theta 1.

68
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,950
And the height of

69
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,490
this surface of both the

70
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,810
particular point theta z or

71
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,540
theta 1, right that's the

72
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,110
vertical axis, the height of

73
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,000
the surface of the points indicates

74
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:30,420
the value of j of theta 0, j of theta 1.

75
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,620
And you can see

76
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:35,200
it sort of has this bow-like shape.

77
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:36,880
Let me show you the same positive 3D.

78
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:43,160
So, here's the same

79
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:44,400
figure in 3D, we're back to

80
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:45,780
theta 0, theta 1 and

81
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,900
vertical access j of theta 0, theta 1.

82
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,010
And if I rotate this, you

83
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,740
know, plot around, you kind

84
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:56,100
of get a sense, I hope, of this dull shape surface.

85
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:59,430
That's what the cost function j looks like.

86
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,880
Now for the purpose of

87
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,040
illustration in the rest of

88
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:03,450
this video, I'm not actually going

89
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,680
to use to these sorts of 3D

90
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:06,340
surfaces to show you

91
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,250
the as function J. Instead,

92
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:12,680
I'm going to use contour plots,

93
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:15,040
or what I also

94
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:19,380
call contour figures-- I guess

95
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,490
they mean the same thing--to show

96
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,040
you these surfaces So, here's

97
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,510
an example of a contour

98
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,280
figure shown on the right,

99
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,730
where the axes are

100
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,120
theta 0 and theta 1.

101
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,380
And what each of

102
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,010
these ovals, each of

103
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,690
these ellipses, shows is a

104
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,420
set of points that takes

105
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,530
on the same value for

106
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:43,870
J of theta 0, theta 1.

107
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,300
So, car 3T, for

108
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,270
example, this you take

109
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,450
that point and that point and that point.

110
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:53,150
All three of these points, that

111
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,880
I just drew in magenta, they

112
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:58,470
have the same value for J of theta 0, theta 1.

113
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:58,710
OK?

114
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,370
Where these are theta 0,

115
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,560
theta 1 axes, but those three

116
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:03,290
have the same value for

117
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,760
J of theta 0, theta 1.

118
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,020
And if you haven't seen

119
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,900
contour plots much before, think

120
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,470
of, imagine if you will

121
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,810
a bow-shaped function that's coming

122
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,510
out of my screen so that

123
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,950
the minimum, so the bottom

124
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,220
of the boat is this point

125
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,130
right there, this middle of

126
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,820
these concentric ellipsis, and imagine

127
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:23,730
a bow shape that grows out

128
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,480
of my screen like this, so

129
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:27,490
that each of these ellipses has

130
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,550
the same height above my screen

131
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,870
and minimum of the bow is right down there.

132
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,670
And so the quantal figure is

133
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,430
a way to, is maybe a

134
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,710
more convenient way, to visualize

135
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,790
my function j. 

So,

136
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,180
let's look at some examples.

137
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,190
Over here I have

138
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,930
a particular point, this is

139
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,790
with theta 0 equals

140
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,590
about 800, and theta

141
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,240
1 equals a

142
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,880
minus 115, and so this

143
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:02,970
point in red

144
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,400
corresponds to one particular

145
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:07,180
pair of values of theta zero, comma theta zero 1.

146
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:09,320
And they correspond in fact,

147
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,700
to that hypothesis, theta zero

148
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:14,040
is about 800, it intersects the vertical

149
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,900
axis at around 800 and this

150
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:19,340
is the slope of about -.15.

151
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,330
Now this line is

152
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,620
really not such a good fit to the data, right?

153
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:25,660
This hypothesis, H(x), with these

154
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:26,370
values of theta 0, theta

155
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,040
1, is really not such a

156
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:29,830
good fit to the data and

157
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,630
so, you find that its cost

158
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,320
is a value that's out here.

159
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:36,610
It's, you know, pretty far from the minimum.

160
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:36,810
Right?

161
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,040
It's pretty far, this is

162
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,220
a pretty high cost because this

163
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:42,410
is just not that good of a fit to the data.

164
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,120
Let's look at some more examples.

165
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:46,050
Now here's a different hypothesis

166
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,460
that's, you know, still not

167
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:49,360
a fit for the data, but maybe slightly better.

168
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,410
So here, right, that's

169
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,830
my point that those

170
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,650
are my parameters, theta 0, theta

171
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,100
1, and so, my

172
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:02,790
theta 0 value, that's

173
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,190
about 360, and my value

174
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,760
for theta 1 is equal to

175
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:11,160
zero, so, you know, let's break that out.

176
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,200
Theta 0 equals 360.

177
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:15,540
Theta 1 equals 0.

178
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:18,210
And this pair of

179
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,270
parameters corresponds to that

180
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,980
hypothesis corresponds to a flat line, right?

181
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:25,730
This is h of x equals

182
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,100
360 plus 0 times x.

183
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:30,110
So, that's my hypothesis and

184
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,420
this hypotheses again have some

185
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,020
cost and that cost

186
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:35,070
is, you know, plotted as

187
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,260
the height of the j

188
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,840
function at that point.

189
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:41,480
Let's look at just this a couple of examples.

190
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:42,670
Here's one more.

191
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,450
You know, at this value

192
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,440
of theta 0 and

193
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:48,190
at that value of theta

194
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,820
1, we end up with

195
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:52,200
this hypothesis, h of

196
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,620
x, and again not the

197
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,010
great input to the data and just

198
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,570
actually, you can even further fit in well.

199
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,020
Last example.

200
00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:59,380
Well, this is actually

201
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,820
not quite at the minimum, but it's pretty close to the minimum.

202
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:02,970
So, this is not such a

203
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,900
bad fit to the data

204
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:07,720
where for a particular value of

205
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,870
theta 0 whatever this

206
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,000
value is and for physical

207
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:13,070
value of theta 1, we

208
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,140
get a physical of h of

209
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,120
x and this is not quite the minimum.

210
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:17,980
This is pretty close and so,

211
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:19,470
the sum of square the errors

212
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,170
that some square distances between my

213
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,760
training examples and my hypothesis.

214
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,720
That's the sum of squared

215
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:30,200
distances of all of these errors.

216
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:34,320
This is pretty close to the minimum, even though it's not quite the minimum.

217
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,140
So, with these figures, I hope

218
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,700
that gives you a better understanding

219
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,520
of what values of

220
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:40,980
the cost function j, how

221
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:42,900
the r and how that corresponds

222
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:45,110
to different hypotheses as well as

223
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,970
how better hypotheses may

224
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,960
correspond to points that closer

225
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,450
to the minimum of this cost

226
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,310
function j. 

Now, of

227
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,920
course, what we really what

228
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,430
is an efficient algorithm like

229
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,070
the efficient piece of software

230
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,110
for automatically finding the

231
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,390
value of theta 0 theta

232
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,980
1 that minimizes the cost function j.

233
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,680
What we don't want to

234
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:06,300
do is have to write

235
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:07,570
software to plot out this

236
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,150
point and then try to manually

237
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,070
read off the numbers.

238
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,560
That this is not a good

239
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:13,610
way to do it, and in fact, we'll see it

240
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,310
later that when we

241
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,630
look at more complicated examples, we

242
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,170
will have high dimensional figures with

243
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,750
more parameters, that it turns

244
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,710
out we'll see and

245
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,130
later in the scores' examples where

246
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,560
This figure here, cannot really

247
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:28,030
be plotted, has become much

248
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,090
harder to visualise, and so

249
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,800
what we want is to have

250
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:34,560
software to find the value

251
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:36,030
of theta 0, theta 1 that

252
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,980
minimizes this function and in

253
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,610
the next video, we'll start

254
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,740
to talk about an algorithm

255
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,890
for automatically finding that

256
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,160
value of theta 0 and

257
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:48,040
theta 1 that minimizes the cost function j.
