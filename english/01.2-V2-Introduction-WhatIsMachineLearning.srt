1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,620
What is Machine Learning?

2
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:02,970
In this video we will try

3
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:04,270
to define what it is and

4
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,190
also try to give you

5
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,310
a sense of when you want to use Machine Learning.

6
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,630
Even among machine learning practitioners

7
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,030
there isn't a well accepted

8
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,360
definition of what is and what isn't Machine Learning.

9
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:16,360
But let me show you a couple

10
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:18,010
of examples of the ways

11
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,380
that people have tried to define

12
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:20,560
it.

13
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:21,900
Here is the definition of what is

14
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:24,990
Machine Learning does do to Arthur Samuel.

15
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,970
He defined Machine Learning as the

16
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:28,900
field of study that gives computers

17
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:32,770
the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

18
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,330
Samuel's claim to fame was

19
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:38,750
that back in the 1950's, he wrote a checkers playing program.

20
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,080
And the amazing thing about

21
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:41,940
this checkers playing program was

22
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:45,550
that Arthur Samuel himself wasn't a very good checkers player.

23
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,640
Well, what he did was

24
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,130
he had to program play tens

25
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,220
of thousands of games against itself.

26
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:51,630
And by watching what sorts of

27
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,970
board positions tended to lead

28
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,340
to wins and what sort

29
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:57,010
of board positions tended to lead to losses.

30
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,750
The checkers playing program learned

31
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,320
over time what are good

32
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:01,710
board positions and what are

33
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,340
bad board positions, and eventually

34
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:05,720
learned to play checkers better than Arthur

35
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:08,130
Samuel himself was able to.

36
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,170
This was a remarkable result.

37
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,920
Arthur Samuel himself turned out

38
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:12,740
not to be a very good

39
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,820
checkers player, but because

40
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:16,620
a computer has the patience

41
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:19,430
to play tens of thousands of games against itself.

42
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,690
No human has the patience to play that many games.

43
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,260
By doing this, the computer was

44
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:25,550
able to get so

45
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,440
much checkers playing experience that

46
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,240
it eventually became a better

47
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,220
checkers player than Arthur Samuel himself.

48
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:34,240
This is somewhat informal

49
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,220
definition and an older one.

50
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,890
Here's a slightly more recent definition

51
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,620
by Tom Mitchell who's a friend of Carnegie Mellon.

52
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:43,170
So, Tom defines Machine

53
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,140
Learning by saying that, a

54
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,920
well opposed learning problem is

55
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:49,010
defined as follows, he says,

56
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,590
a computer program is said

57
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,310
to learn from experience E with respect to

58
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,500
some task T and some performance

59
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,320
measure P. And if this performance

60
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:58,560
on T as measured by P

61
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:00,820
improves some experience E. I

62
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:04,180
actually think he came up with this definition just to make it rhyme.

63
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,200
Well the checkers-playing example is:

64
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,000
the experience E would

65
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:09,380
be the experience of having

66
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:10,680
the program play tens of

67
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:13,270
thousands of games against itself.

68
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,510
The Task T would be

69
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,600
the task of playing checkers

70
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,270
and the performance measure P would

71
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,040
be the probability that it

72
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:23,930
wins the next game of checkers against some new opponent.

73
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,870
Throughout these videos, besides me

74
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,540
trying to teach you stuff, I'll

75
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,620
occasionally ask you a

76
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:31,790
question to make sure you understand the content.

77
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,410
Here's one.

78
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,940
On top is a definition of

79
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,670
"Machine Learning" by Tom Mitchell.

80
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,910
Let's say your email program watches

81
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,690
which emails you do or do not tag as spam.

82
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,080
So, in an email plan

83
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:45,170
like this, you might click the

84
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,040
spam button to report

85
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:48,200
some email as spam but

86
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,670
not all the emails, and

87
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,910
based on which emails you mark as spam.

88
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,500
Say your email program learns

89
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:58,580
better how to filter spam email.

90
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:01,490
What is the task T in this setting?

91
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,910
In a few seconds, the video

92
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,020
will pause and when it

93
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,450
does so, you can use

94
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,110
your mouse to select one of

95
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,160
these four radio buttons to

96
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,470
let, to let me know

97
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,880
which of these four you think

98
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:14,550
is the right answer to this question.

99
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,420
So hopefully you got that

100
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:21,290
this is the right answer, because find emails is a task T.

101
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,380
In fact, this definition defines

102
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,390
a task T, a performance measure

103
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,090
P, and this experience

104
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,380
E. And so watching

105
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:31,900
you label emails, as spam

106
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,850
or not spam, this would be

107
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:36,880
the experience E, and the

108
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:39,480
fraction of emails correctly classified

109
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:41,520
that might be a performance

110
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:44,250
measure P. And so

111
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,380
our task performance, on the

112
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,300
task about systems performance, on

113
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,200
the task T, on the

114
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:52,180
perform measure P will improve

115
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:55,250
after the experience E. In

116
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,370
this class I hope to teach

117
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:59,440
you about various different types of learning algorithms.

118
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:01,910
There are several different types of learning algorithms.

119
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,190
The main two types are what

120
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,110
we call Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Learning.

121
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,460
I'll define what these terms mean more in the next couple of videos.

122
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,040
But it turns out that in

123
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:14,430
Supervised Learning, the idea

124
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,010
is we're going to teach the computer

125
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,890
how to do something, whereas

126
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,940
in Unsupervised Learning, we're going to let it learn by itself.

127
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:24,890
Don't worry if these two terms don't make sense yet.

128
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,280
In the next two videos, I'm

129
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:28,750
going to say exactly what these two types of learning are.

130
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,840
You might also hear

131
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,410
other buzz terms such as

132
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:36,460
"Reinforcement Learning" and "Recommender Systems".

133
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:39,690
These are other types of Machine Learning algorithms that we'll talk about later.

134
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,410
But the two most

135
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,780
used types of learning algorithms

136
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,920
are probably Supervised Learning and

137
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,740
Unsupervised Learning and Define

138
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,030
them in the next two videos

139
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:52,110
and we'll spend most this class talking about these two types of learning algorithms.

140
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,990
It turns out one of the

141
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,080
other things we'll spend a lot

142
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:56,430
of time on in this class is

143
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,520
practical advice for applying learning algorithms.

144
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:01,500
This is something that I feel

145
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,080
pretty strongly about and it's

146
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:04,170
actually something that I don't know

147
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,950
if any other university teaches.

148
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,080
Teaching about learning algorithms

149
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,640
is like giving a set of

150
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:12,120
tools, and equally important

151
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,550
or more important than giving

152
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,000
you the tools is to teach you how to apply these tools.

153
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:20,810
I like to make an analogy to learning to become a carpenter.

154
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,170
Imagine that someone is teaching

155
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,650
you how to be a carpenter, and

156
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,700
they say here's a hammer,

157
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:29,160
here's a screwdriver, here's a saw, good luck.

158
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,390
Well that's no good, right?

159
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,900
You have all these tools

160
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,600
but the more important thing, is

161
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:36,450
to learn how to use these tools properly.

162
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,980
There's a huge difference between people

163
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,160
that know how to use these

164
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:42,230
Machine Learning algorithms versus people

165
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,210
that don't know how to use these tools well.

166
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,850
Here in Silicon Valley where

167
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,450
I live, when I

168
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,210
go visit different companies, even

169
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,240
the top Silicon Valley companies,

170
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,680
very often I see people

171
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:54,140
trying to apply Machine Learning

172
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:56,020
algorithms to some problem, and

173
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,560
sometimes they'll have been going

174
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,510
at it for six months, but sometimes

175
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,910
when they look at what they're doing,

176
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,080
I say, you know, I could

177
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:03,190
of told them like "Gee, I

178
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,380
could of told you six months

179
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:06,230
ago that you should

180
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,070
be taking a learning algorithm and

181
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,830
applying it in like the

182
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,370
slightly modified way and

183
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:15,730
your chance of success would have been much higher."

184
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,850
So what we're gonna

185
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,120
do in this class is actually

186
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:19,350
spend a lot of time talking

187
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,910
about how, if you're actually

188
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,110
trying to develop a Machine

189
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,890
Learning system, how to

190
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,670
make those best practices type

191
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,380
decisions, about the way

192
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,000
in which you build your system, so

193
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:30,790
that when you're applying learning algorithm, you

194
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,930
are less likely to end up

195
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:32,980
one of those people who end

196
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,170
up pursuing some path for

197
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,070
six months that you know,

198
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,040
someone else could have figured

199
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:41,080
out just wasn't gonna work at all and was just a waste of time for six months.

200
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,680
So I'm actually gonna spend

201
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:44,580
a lot of time teaching you those sorts

202
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:46,320
of best practices and Machine Learning

203
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,350
and AI, and how to get those stuff to work.

204
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,370
And how we do it and

205
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:53,380
how the best people do it, is Silicon Valley and around the world.

206
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,200
I hope to make you one of

207
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:55,980
the best people at knowing how

208
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,490
to design and build serious

209
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,150
Machine Learning and AI systems.

210
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,880
So that's Machine Learning and

211
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:04,280
these are the main topics I hope to teach.

212
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,610
In the next video I'm going

213
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,030
to define what is

214
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,750
Supervised Learning and after

215
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,580
that what is Unsupervised Learning and

216
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:11,630
also, we'll start to talk

217
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,860
about when you would use each of them.
