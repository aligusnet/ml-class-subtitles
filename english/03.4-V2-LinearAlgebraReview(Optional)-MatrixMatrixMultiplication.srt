1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:01,530
In this video we talk about

2
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:03,570
matrix, matrix multiplication or

3
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,580
how to multiply two matrices together.

4
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:07,920
When we talk about the method

5
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:09,380
in linear regression for how

6
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,190
to solve for the parameters,

7
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,170
theta zero and theta one, all in one shot.

8
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:16,590
So, without needing an iterative algorithm like gradient descent.

9
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,130
When we talk about that algorithm,

10
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:19,960
it turns out that matrix, matrix

11
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:24,040
multiplication is one of the key steps that you need to know.

12
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:28,400
So, let's, as usual, start with an example.

13
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:30,650
Let's say I have two matrices

14
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,030
and I want to multiply them together.

15
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,320
Let me again just reference this

16
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:37,990
example and then I'll tell you in a little bit what happens.

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,150
So, the first thing

18
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,570
I'm gonna do is, I'm going

19
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,160
to pull out the first

20
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:46,330
column of this matrix on the right.

21
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,120
And I'm going to take this

22
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:49,160
matrix on the left and

23
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,330
multiply it by, you know, a vector.

24
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,100
That's just this first column, OK?

25
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,290
And it turns out if I

26
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:59,060
do that I am going to get the vector 11, 9.

27
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,040
So, this is the same matrix

28
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:05,940
vector multiplication as you saw in the last videos.

29
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,910
I worked this out in advance so, I know it's 11, 9.

30
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,500
And, then, the second thing

31
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,780
I'm going to do is, I'm going

32
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:14,860
to pull out the second column,

33
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,500
this matrix on the right and

34
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,750
I am then going to

35
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,160
take this matrix on the left,

36
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:21,400
right, so, it will be that matrix,

37
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:23,470
and multiply it by

38
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,880
that second column on the right.

39
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:27,050
So, again, this is a matrix

40
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,930
vector multiplication set, which

41
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,630
you saw from the previous video, and

42
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,570
it turns out that if you

43
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:32,770
multiply this matrix and this

44
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,240
vector, you get 10,

45
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,180
14 and by

46
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:37,460
the way, if you want to practice

47
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,760
your matrix vector multiplication, feel

48
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:43,160
free to pause the video and check this product yourself.

49
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,210
Then, I'm just going

50
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,720
to take these two results and

51
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,390
put them together, and that will be my answer.

52
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,920
So, turns out the

53
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:51,300
outcome of this product is going

54
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:53,420
to be a 2 by 2 matrix, and

55
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,430
The way I am going to fill

56
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,280
in this matrix is just by

57
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:57,900
taking my elements 11,

58
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,130
9 and plugging them here, and

59
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:03,330
taking 10, 14 and plugging

60
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:06,710
them into the second column.

61
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,420
Okay?

62
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,740
So, that was the mechanics of

63
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,440
how to multiply a matrix by

64
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:12,270
another matrix.

65
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,000
You basically look at the

66
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:17,060
second matrix one column at a time, and you assemble the answers.

67
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,120
And again, we will step

68
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:19,340
through this much more carefully in

69
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:20,690
a second, but I just

70
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,800
want to point out also, this

71
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:26,290
first example is a 2x3 matrix matrix.

72
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,540
Multiplying that by a

73
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,630
3x2 matrix, and the

74
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,460
outcome of this product, it

75
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:35,110
turns out to be a 2x2

76
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:36,470
matrix.

77
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,620
And again, we'll see in a second why this was the case.

78
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,780
All right.

79
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,610
That was the mechanics of the calculation.

80
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,710
Let's actually look at the

81
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,950
details and look at what

82
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,760
exactly happened.

83
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,050
Here are details.

84
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,380
I have a matrix A and

85
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,340
I want to multiply that

86
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:53,050
with a matrix B, and the result

87
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:56,090
will be some new matrix C. And

88
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,140
it turns out you can only

89
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,130
multiply together matrices whose

90
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,680
dimensions match so A

91
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:02,230
is an m by n matrix,

92
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,410
so m columns, n columns and

93
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,380
I am going to multiply

94
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,490
that with an n by o

95
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,200
and it turns out this n

96
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:10,320
here must match this n

97
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,950
here, so the number of columns

98
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:16,170
in first matrix must equal to the number of rows in second matrix.

99
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,000
And the result of this

100
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:20,620
product will be an M

101
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:25,380
by O matrix, like the the matrix C here.

102
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,820
And, in the previous

103
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,760
video, everything we did corresponded

104
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:31,350
to this special case of OB

105
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,420
equal to 1.

106
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:32,660
Okay?

107
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,470
That was, that was in case of B being a vector.

108
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,520
But now, we are going to

109
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:39,780
view of the case of values of O larger than 1.

110
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,530
So, here's how you

111
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,530
multiply together the two matrices.

112
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,330
In order to get, what

113
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,760
I am going to do is

114
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,260
I am going to take the

115
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,980
first column of B

116
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,740
and treat that as a vector,

117
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,110
and multiply the matrix A,

118
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,920
with the first column of B,

119
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,620
and the result of that will

120
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,390
be a M by 1 vector,

121
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,060
and we're going to put that over here.

122
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,470
Then, I'm going to

123
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,010
take the second column

124
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:12,000
of B, right, so,

125
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:13,780
this is another n by

126
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,450
one vector, so, this column

127
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,680
here, this is right, n

128
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:17,880
by one, those are n dimensional

129
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,740
vector, gonna multiply this

130
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,650
matrix with this n by one vector.

131
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,680
The result will be

132
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:26,440
a M dimensional vector,

133
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,150
which we'll put there.

134
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,010
And, so on.

135
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:29,400
Okay?

136
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:30,730
And, so, you know, and then

137
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,010
I'm going to take the third

138
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,420
column, multiply it by

139
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:37,500
this matrix, I get a M dimensional vector.

140
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,280
And so on, until you get

141
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:40,600
to the last column times,

142
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:41,940
the matrix times the

143
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,520
lost column gives you

144
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:46,450
the lost column of C.

145
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:48,600
Just to say that again.

146
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,590
The ith column of the

147
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,800
matrix C is attained

148
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:56,100
by taking the matrix A and

149
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,650
multiplying the matrix A with

150
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,590
the ith column of the

151
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,550
matrix B for the values

152
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,460
of I equals 1, 2

153
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,940
up through O. Okay ?

154
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,750
So, this is just a summary

155
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,750
of what we did up there

156
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,070
in order to compute the matrix

157
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,930
C.  Let's look at just one more example.

158
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:17,150
Let 's say, I want to multiply together these two matrices.

159
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,150
So, what I'm going to

160
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,150
do is, first pull

161
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,500
out the first column

162
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,350
of my second matrix, that

163
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,150
was matrix B, that was

164
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,150
my matrix B on the previous slide.

165
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,640
And, I therefore, have this

166
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:32,910
matrix times my vector and

167
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,290
so, oh, let's do this calculation quickly.

168
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,420
There's going to be equal to,

169
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,020
right, 1, 3 times 0,

170
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:41,260
3 so that gives 1

171
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:45,880
times 0, plus 3 times 3.

172
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:48,290
And, the second element

173
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,520
is going to be 2,

174
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:51,590
5 times 0, 3 so, that's going to

175
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,730
be two times 0 plus 5

176
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:57,230
times 3 and that is

177
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:02,190
9,15, actually didn't

178
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,580
write that in green, so this

179
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:09,350
is nine fifteen, and then mix.

180
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,080
I am going to pull out

181
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:14,420
the second column of this,

182
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,180
and do the corresponding

183
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:18,190
calculation so there's this

184
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,430
matrix times this vector 1, 2.

185
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,280
Let's also do this

186
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:23,750
quickly, so that's one times

187
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,340
one plus three times two.

188
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,940
So that deals with that

189
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,790
row, let's do the

190
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,210
other one, so let's see,

191
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:37,470
that gives me two times

192
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:41,580
one plus times two,

193
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,480
so that is going to

194
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:46,120
be equal to, let's see,

195
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:47,400
one times one plus three times

196
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:50,360
one is four and two

197
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:52,240
times one plus five times two

198
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,700
is twelve.

199
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:56,640
So now I have these two

200
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,420
you, and so my

201
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,290
outcome, so the product

202
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,680
of these two matrices is going

203
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:03,820
to be, this goes

204
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:07,210
here and this

205
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,770
goes here, so I

206
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:14,650
get nine fifteen and

207
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:17,820
four twelve and you

208
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,660
may notice also that the result

209
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,510
of multiplying a 2x2 matrix

210
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,640
with another 2x2 matrix.

211
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,160
The resulting dimension is going

212
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,580
to be that first two times

213
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,420
that second two, so the result

214
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:32,960
is itself also a two by two matrix.

215
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,290
Finally let me show you

216
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,760
one more neat trick you can

217
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:40,830
do with matrix matrix multiplication.

218
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,440
Let's say as before that we

219
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:45,790
have four houses whose

220
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,270
prices we want to predict,

221
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:49,780
only now we have three

222
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:51,960
competing hypothesis shown here

223
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:54,110
on the right, so if

224
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,690
you want to So apply all

225
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,640
3 competing hypotheses to

226
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:58,870
all four of the houses, it

227
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,910
turns out you can do that

228
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,660
very efficiently using a

229
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:05,100
matrix matrix multiplication so here

230
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,360
on the left is my usual

231
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,510
matrix, same as from the

232
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,990
last video where these values

233
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,910
are my housing prices and I put ones there on the left as well.

234
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,510
And, what I'm going to

235
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,100
do is construct another matrix, where

236
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,690
here these, the first

237
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,470
column, is this minus

238
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,060
40 and two five and

239
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:28,340
the second column is this two

240
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:31,450
hundred open one and so

241
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:34,240
on and it

242
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,820
turns out that if you

243
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:37,900
multiply these two matrices

244
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:40,430
what you find is that, this

245
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,450
first column, you know,

246
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:46,390
oh, well how do you get this first column, right?

247
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,770
A procedure from matrix

248
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,540
matrix multiplication is the way

249
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,950
you get this first column, is

250
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,410
you take this matrix and you

251
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:54,830
multiply it by this

252
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,700
first column, and we

253
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:58,530
saw in the previous video that this

254
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,480
is exactly the predicted

255
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:02,140
housing prices of the

256
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:05,670
first hypothesis, right?

257
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,660
Of this first hypothesis here.

258
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,760
And, how about a second column?

259
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:12,980
Well, how do setup the second column?

260
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,310
The way you get the second column

261
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,580
is, well, you take this

262
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:19,260
matrix and you multiply by this second column.

263
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:21,280
And so this second column turns

264
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:24,610
out to be the predictions of

265
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:27,740
the second hypothesis of

266
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,130
the second hypothesis up there,

267
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:34,430
and similarly for the third column.

268
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,800
And so, I didn't step

269
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:38,000
through all the details but hopefully

270
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,130
you just, feel free to

271
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,310
pause the video and check

272
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,770
the math yourself and check

273
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,980
that what I just claimed really is true.

274
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,570
But it turns out that by

275
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,440
constructing these two matrices, what

276
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:48,930
you can therefore do is very

277
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:51,060
quickly apply all three

278
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:52,570
hypotheses to all four

279
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,420
house sizes to get,

280
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:56,390
you know, all twelve predicted

281
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,690
prices output by your

282
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,870
three hypotheses on your four houses.

283
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,320
So one matrix multiplications

284
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,070
that you manage to make 12

285
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,120
predictions and, even

286
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:08,420
better, it turns out that

287
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:09,840
in order to do that matrix

288
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:11,360
multiplication and there are

289
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:13,140
lots of good linear algebra libraries

290
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,730
in order to do this

291
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,660
multiplication step for you,

292
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,220
and no matter so pretty

293
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:22,000
much any reasonable programming language that you might be using.

294
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:23,870
Certainly all the top ten

295
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,820
most popular programming languages will have great linear algebra libraries.

296
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,530
And they'll be good thing are

297
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,450
highly optimized in order

298
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,430
to do that, matrix matrix

299
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,390
multiplication very efficiently, including

300
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,450
taking, taking advantage of

301
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:41,120
any parallel computation that

302
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:42,830
your computer may be capable

303
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,120
of, when your computer has multiple

304
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:48,160
calls or lots of

305
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:49,800
multiple processors, within a processor sometimes

306
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:53,260
there's there's parallelism as well called symdiparallelism [sp].

307
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:55,340
The computer take care of

308
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:56,720
and you should, there are

309
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,810
very good free libraries

310
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,120
that you can use to do

311
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:02,290
this matrix matrix multiplication very

312
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,100
efficiently so that you

313
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,920
can very efficiently, you

314
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:09,130
know, makes lots of predictions of lots of hypotheses.
