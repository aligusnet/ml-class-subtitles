1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,880
matrix multiplication is really

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:03,260
useful since you can pack

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,460
a lot of computation into just

4
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:08,100
one matrix multiplication operation.

5
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:10,790
But you should be careful of how you use them.

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,080
In this video I want to

7
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,920
tell you about a few properties of matrix multiplication.

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,670
When working with just raw

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,630
numbers or when working with

10
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:26,000
scalars, multiplication is commutative.

11
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,430
And what I mean by that is

12
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,260
if you take three times

13
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:30,830
five, that is equal

14
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,370
to five times three and

15
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,300
the ordering of this multiplication doesn't matter.

16
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:38,240
And this is called the commutative

17
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:42,130
property of multiplication of real numbers.

18
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:43,760
It turns out this property that

19
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,300
you can, you know, reverse

20
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:46,290
the order in which you

21
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:50,250
multiply things, this is not true for matrix multiplication.So

22
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,230
concretely, if A and

23
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,390
B are matrices, then in

24
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,110
general, A times B is

25
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,640
not equal to B times

26
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:58,170
A.  So just be careful of that.

27
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:00,540
It's not okay to arbitrarily reverse

28
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:02,480
the order in which you are multiplying matrices.

29
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:04,790
So, we say that matrix multiplication

30
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,390
is not commutative, it's a fancy

31
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,550
way of saying it.

32
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,280
As a concrete example, here

33
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:13,120
are two matrices, matrix 1100

34
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:14,280
times 0020, and if you multiply

35
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:17,010
these two matrices, you get this result on the right.

36
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:20,450
Now, let's swap around the order of these two matrices.

37
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,780
So, I'm going to take these

38
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,240
two matrices and just reverse them.

39
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,500
It turns out if you multiply

40
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:27,620
these two matrices, you get

41
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,430
the second answer on the

42
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,090
right and, you know, real

43
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,610
clearly, these two matrices are

44
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:36,630
not equal to each other.

45
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,130
So, in fact, in

46
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,110
general, if you have

47
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,550
a matrix operation like

48
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,780
A times B. If A

49
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:47,460
is an m by n matrix

50
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:49,200
and B is an by

51
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:52,420
M matrix, just as an example.

52
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,970
Then, it turns out

53
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,690
that the matrix A times

54
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,010
B right, is going

55
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,270
to be an m by

56
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,750
m matrix, where as

57
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,450
the matrix b x a

58
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,440
is going to be an n

59
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:09,880
by n matrix so the

60
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:11,400
dimensions don't even match, right,

61
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:13,280
so A times B and

62
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,680
B times A may not even be the same dimension.

63
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:17,590
In the example on the left,

64
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,210
I have all two by two matrices,

65
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,260
so the dimensions were the same,

66
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,640
but in general reversing the

67
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:25,310
order of the matrices

68
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,230
can even change the dimension

69
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,000
of the outcome so

70
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:33,160
matrix multiplication is not commutative.

71
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:36,270
Here's the next I want to talk about.

72
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,670
So, when talking about real

73
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,680
numbers, or scalars, let's

74
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,850
see, I have 3 times 5 times 2.

75
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,800
I can either multiply 5

76
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,530
times 2 first, and

77
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,420
I can compute this as 3 times 10.

78
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,910
Or, I can multiply

79
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,610
three times five for us and

80
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,780
I can compute this as, you

81
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:58,010
know fifteen times two and

82
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,830
both of these give you the same answer, right?

83
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,050
Each, both of these is equal

84
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,900
to thirty so Whether I

85
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:06,400
multiply five times

86
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,160
two first or whether I

87
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:09,730
multiply three times five

88
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:12,620
first because well, three

89
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,660
times five times two

90
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,320
is equal to three times

91
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,870
five times two.

92
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,410
And this is called the

93
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:27,010
associative property of role number multiplication.

94
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:30,680
It turns out that matrix multiplication is associative.

95
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,280
So concretely, let's say

96
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:33,410
I have a product of three

97
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,740
matrices, A times B times

98
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,160
C. Then I can

99
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:37,830
compute this either as A

100
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,450
times, B times C

101
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,780
or I can compute this as

102
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:45,700
A times B, times C

103
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:48,100
and these will actually give me the same answer.

104
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,260
I'm not going to prove this, but

105
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,530
you can just take my word for it, I guess.

106
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,640
So just be clear what I mean by

107
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,260
these two cases, let's look

108
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,260
at first one first case.

109
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,290
What I mean by that is

110
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,350
if you actually want to compute

111
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,890
A times B times C, what

112
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,390
you can do is you can

113
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,090
first compute B times C.

114
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,390
So that D equals B time

115
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,820
C, then compute A times

116
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,190
D.  And so this is really

117
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,540
computing a times B

118
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:12,430
times C.  Or, for

119
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,860
this second case, You can

120
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,000
compute this as, you can

121
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,670
set E equals A

122
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,090
times B.  Then compute E

123
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,740
times C.  And this

124
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,910
is then the same as a

125
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,520
times B times C

126
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,300
and it turns out that both

127
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:30,090
of these options will give

128
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:33,650
you, is guaranteed to give you the same answer.

129
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,100
And so we say that matrix

130
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:39,930
multiplication does enjoy the associative property.

131
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:40,990
Okay?

132
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,710
And don't worry about the terminology

133
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,230
associative and commutative that's

134
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,150
why there's not really going to use

135
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,520
this terminology later in these

136
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:50,600
class, so don't worry about memorizing those terms.

137
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,790
Finally, I want to

138
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,170
tell you about the identity

139
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,650
matrix, which is special matrix.

140
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,200
So let's again make the

141
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,280
analogy to what we know

142
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,330
of real numbers, so when dealing

143
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,780
with real numbers or scalar

144
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,560
numbers, the number one,

145
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,110
is you can think

146
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,800
of it as the identity of multiplication,

147
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:10,820
and what I mean by that

148
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,860
is for any number

149
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,940
Z, the number 1

150
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,800
times z is equal

151
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:19,720
to z times one, and

152
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,490
that's just equal to

153
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,490
the number z, right, for any real number.

154
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,080
Z. So 1 is

155
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:29,890
the identity operation and so it satisfies this equation.

156
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,690
So it turns out that

157
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,260
in the space of matrices as

158
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,430
an identity matrix as well.

159
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,370
And it's unusually denoted i,

160
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,550
or sometimes we write it

161
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,960
as i of n by

162
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:43,010
n we want to make explicit the dimensions.

163
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,280
So I subscript n by n

164
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:47,750
is the n by n identity matrix.

165
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,320
And so there's a different identity

166
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:53,400
matrix for each dimension n and are a few examples.

167
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:54,890
Here's the two by two identity

168
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,390
matrix, here's the three

169
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,820
by three identity matrix, here's the four by four identity matrix.

170
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,820
So the identity matrix, has the

171
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,560
property that it has

172
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:06,110
ones along the diagonals,

173
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,300
right, and so on and

174
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,880
is zero everywhere else, and

175
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:13,990
so, by the way the

176
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,380
one by one identity matrix is just a number one.

177
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,730
This is one by one matrix

178
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,050
just and it's not a very

179
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,450
interesting identity matrix and informally

180
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:24,600
when I or others are being

181
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:26,380
sloppy, very often, we will

182
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:28,870
write the identity matrix using fine notation.

183
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,610
I draw, you know, let's

184
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,610
go back to it and just write 1111,

185
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,490
dot, dot, dot, 1

186
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,930
and then we'll, maybe, somewhat

187
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,650
sloppily write a bunch of zeros there.

188
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:40,720
And these zeros, this

189
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,460
big zero, this big zero

190
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,230
that's meant to denote that this

191
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,130
matrix is zero everywhere except for

192
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,280
the diagonals, so this is just

193
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:49,660
how I might sloppily write

194
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:53,210
this identity matrix

195
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,100
She says property that for

196
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:57,450
any matrix A, A times

197
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,650
identity i times A

198
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,820
A. So that's a lot

199
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:04,780
like this equation that we have up here.

200
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,470
One times z equals z times

201
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,420
one, equals z itself so

202
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,960
I times A equals A

203
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:12,560
times I equals A.  Just

204
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:14,060
make sure we have the dimensions right, so

205
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,700
if A is a n

206
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:18,070
by n matrix, then this

207
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,920
identity matrix that's an

208
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:23,020
m by n identity matrix.

209
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,520
And if A is m by

210
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:26,550
n then this identity

211
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,710
matrix, right, for matrix

212
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,280
multiplication make sense that has a

213
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:32,970
m by n matrix because

214
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,280
this m has a match

215
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,910
up that m And

216
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,580
in either case the outcome

217
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:40,000
of this process is you

218
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:42,020
get back to Matrix A, which

219
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:44,520
is m by n.

220
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,020
So whenever we write

221
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,660
the identity matrix I, you

222
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:50,800
know, very often the dimension rightwill

223
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,450
be implicit from the context.

224
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,640
So these two I's they' re

225
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:55,620
actually different dimension matrices, one

226
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:56,770
may be N by N, the other

227
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,950
is M by M But when

228
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,500
we want to make the dimension

229
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,830
of the matrix explicit, then sometimes

230
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,470
we'll write to this I subscript

231
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,430
N by N, kind of like we have up here.

232
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,600
But very often the dimension will be implicit.

233
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,480
Finally, just want to point

234
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:14,550
out that earlier I

235
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,420
said that A times B

236
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:19,040
is not in general equal

237
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:22,580
to B times A, right?

238
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:25,680
That for most matrices A and B, this is not true.

239
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:29,570
But when B is the identity matrix, this does hold true.

240
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,860
That A times the identity

241
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:33,330
matrix does indeed equal to

242
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,440
identity times A, it's

243
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:35,800
just that this is not true

244
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:39,270
for other matrices, B in general.

245
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,620
So that's it for the

246
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,960
properties of matrix multiplication.

247
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:45,380
And the special matrices, like the

248
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,550
identity matrix I want to

249
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,480
tell you about, in the next

250
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:51,650
and final video now linear algebra review.

251
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,340
I am going to quickly tell you

252
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:55,820
about a couple of special

253
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:58,170
matrix operations, and after

254
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,240
that you know everything you need

255
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:03,330
to know about linear algebra for this course
