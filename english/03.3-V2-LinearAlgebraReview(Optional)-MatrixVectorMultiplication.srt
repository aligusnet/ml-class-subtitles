1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,350
In this video, I'd like

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:02,650
to start talking about how to

3
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:05,210
multiply together two matrices.

4
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,600
We'll start with a special case

5
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:08,340
of that, of matrix vector

6
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:12,720
multiplication -  multiplying a matrix together with a vector.

7
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:13,930
Let's start with an example.

8
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:15,670
Here is a matrix,

9
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,220
and here is a vector, and

10
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:18,290
let's say we want to

11
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,260
multiply together this matrix

12
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,130
with this vector, what's the result?

13
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,200
Let me just work through this

14
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:27,040
example and then we

15
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:29,840
can step back and look at just what the steps were.

16
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:31,050
It turns out the result of

17
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:32,860
this multiplication process is going

18
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:34,550
to be, itself, a vector.

19
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,940
And I'm just going work

20
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:37,080
with this first and later we'll

21
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:39,780
come back and see just what I did here.

22
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,200
To get the first element of

23
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:42,410
this vector I am going

24
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,070
to take these two numbers

25
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:47,650
and multiply them with

26
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,430
the first row of the

27
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,870
matrix and add up the corresponding numbers.

28
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,180
Take one multiplied by

29
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:57,420
one, and take

30
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:58,600
three and multiply it by

31
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:01,570
five, and that's

32
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:04,520
what, that's one plus fifteen so that gives me sixteen.

33
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,870
I'm going to write sixteen here.

34
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,910
then for the second row,

35
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,530
second element, I am

36
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,990
going to take the second row

37
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,220
and multiply it by this vector,

38
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:17,790
so I have four

39
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,520
times one, plus zero

40
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:21,860
times five, which is

41
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:25,590
equal to four, so you'll have four there.

42
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,150
And finally for the last

43
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,000
one I have two one times

44
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:31,500
one five, so two

45
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,770
by one, plus one

46
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,350
by 5, which is equal

47
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,030
to a 7, and

48
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:43,230
so I get a 7 over there.

49
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:45,440
It turns out that the

50
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:48,090
results of multiplying that's

51
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,020
a 3x2 matrix by a

52
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,470
2x1 matrix is also

53
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,470
just a two-dimensional vector.

54
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,030
The result of this is

55
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,060
going to be a 3x1

56
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,950
matrix, so that's why

57
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,740
three by one 3x1

58
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,540
matrix, in other words

59
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:13,010
a 3x1 matrix is just a three dimensional vector.

60
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,300
So I realize that I

61
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,010
did that pretty quickly, and you're

62
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,010
probably not sure that you can

63
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,510
repeat this process yourself, but

64
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,130
let's look in more detail

65
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,010
at what just happened and what

66
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,410
this process of multiplying a matrix by a vector looks like.

67
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,440
Here's the details of how to

68
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,530
multiply a matrix by a vector.

69
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,940
Let's say I have a matrix A

70
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,330
and want to multiply it by

71
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,620
a vector x. The

72
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,190
result is going to be some

73
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,530
vector y. So the

74
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,290
matrix A is a m

75
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,340
by n dimensional matrix, so

76
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:45,030
m rows and n columns and

77
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,550
we are going to multiply that by a

78
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,630
n by 1 matrix, in other words an n dimensional vector.

79
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,170
It turns out this

80
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,670
"n" here has to match this "n" here.

81
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,920
In other words, the number of

82
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:58,570
columns in this matrix, so

83
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,900
it's the number of n columns.

84
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,390
The number of columns here has

85
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,370
to match the number of rows here.

86
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:09,270
It has to match the dimension of this vector.

87
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,590
And the result of this product

88
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:15,550
is going to be an n-dimensional

89
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,830
vector y.  Rows here.

90
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,000
"M" is going

91
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,880
to be equal to the number

92
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:28,060
of rows in this matrix "A".

93
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,070
So how do you actually compute this vector "Y"?

94
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,090
Well it turns out to compute

95
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,230
this vector "Y", the process

96
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,190
is to get "Y""I", multiply "A's"

97
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,710
"I'th" row with the

98
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,200
elements of the vector "X"

99
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:41,620
and add them up.

100
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,460
So here's what I mean.

101
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:45,050
In order to get the

102
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,010
first element of "Y",

103
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:49,900
that first number--whatever that turns

104
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,400
out to be--we're gonna take

105
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:53,010
the first row of the

106
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,450
matrix "A" and multiply

107
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,650
them one at a time

108
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,830
with the elements of this vector "X".

109
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,750
So I take this first number

110
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,050
multiply it by this first number.

111
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:07,320
Then take the second number multiply it by this second number.

112
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,250
Take this third number whatever

113
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,590
that is, multiply it the third number

114
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,310
and so on until you get to the end.

115
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,520
And I'm gonna add up the

116
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,290
results of these products and the

117
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,910
result of paying that out is going to give us this first element of "Y".

118
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,670
Then when we want to get

119
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,330
the second element of "Y", let's say this element.

120
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,680
The way we do that is we

121
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:28,640
take the second row of

122
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,060
A and we repeat the whole thing.

123
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,240
So we take the second row

124
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,960
of A, and multiply it

125
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,390
elements-wise, so the elements

126
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,820
of X and add

127
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,430
up the results of the products

128
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,360
and that would give me the

129
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,080
second element of Y. And

130
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:41,590
you keep going to get and we

131
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,840
going to take the third row

132
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,710
of A, multiply element Ys

133
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,550
with the vector x,

134
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,650
sum up the results and then

135
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,250
I get the third element and so

136
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,560
on, until I get down

137
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:56,420
to the last row like so, okay?

138
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,250
So that's the procedure.

139
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,570
Let's do one more example.

140
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:05,130
Here's the example:  So let's look at the dimensions.

141
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:08,370
Here, this is a three

142
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:11,070
by four dimensional matrix.

143
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,260
This is a four-dimensional vector,

144
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,270
or a 4 x 1 matrix, and

145
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,780
so the result of this, the

146
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,210
result of this product is going

147
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,880
to be a three-dimensional vector.

148
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:23,170
Write, you know, the vector,

149
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:26,470
with room for three elements.

150
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:30,210
Let's do the, let's carry out the products.

151
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,870
So for the first element, I'm

152
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,050
going to take these four numbers

153
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,240
and multiply them with the

154
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,820
vector X. So I have

155
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:42,250
1x1, plus 2x3,

156
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:47,660
plus 1x2, plus 5x1, which

157
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:50,040
is equal to - that's

158
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:55,620
1+6, plus 2+6, which gives me 14.

159
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:58,020
And then for the

160
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:59,700
second element, I'm going

161
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,370
to take this row now and

162
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:04,490
multiply it with this vector  (0x1)+3.

163
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,110
All right, so

164
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:13,400
0x1+  3x3 plus

165
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:18,950
0x2 plus 4x1,

166
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:25,010
which is equal to, let's

167
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,020
see that's 9+4, which is 13.

168
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,460
And finally, for the last

169
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,440
element, I'm going to take

170
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:30,630
this last row, so I

171
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,100
have minus one times one.

172
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:38,070
You have minus two, or really there's a plus next to a two I guess.

173
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,620
Times three plus zero

174
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,390
times two plus zero times

175
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,980
one, and so that's

176
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,450
going to be minus one minus

177
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,390
six, which is going to make

178
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,540
this seven, and so that's vector seven.

179
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:49,620
Okay?

180
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:51,060
So my final answer is this

181
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:54,020
vector fourteen, just to

182
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:56,090
write to that without the colors, fourteen,

183
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,020
thirteen, negative seven.

184
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,510
And as promised, the

185
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,750
result here is a three by one matrix.

186
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,160
So that's how you multiply a matrix and a vector.

187
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:12,290
I know that a lot just

188
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,680
happened on this slide, so

189
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:14,670
if you're not quite sure where all

190
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,190
these numbers went, you know,

191
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,270
feel free to pause the video

192
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,300
you know, and so take a

193
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,930
slow careful look at this

194
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,130
big calculation that we just

195
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,280
did and try to make

196
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,750
sure that you understand the steps

197
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,130
of what just happened to get

198
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:29,470
us these numbers,fourteen, thirteen and eleven.

199
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,940
Finally, let me show you a neat trick.

200
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,930
Let's say we have

201
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:36,390
a set of four houses so 4

202
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,630
houses with 4 sizes like these.

203
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,850
And let's say I have a

204
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,410
hypotheses for predicting what is

205
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,880
the price of a house, and

206
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:45,760
let's say I want to compute,

207
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:49,280
you know, H of X for each of my 4 houses here.

208
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:50,910
It turns out there's neat way

209
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,970
of posing this, applying this

210
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:56,730
hypothesis to all of my houses at the same time.

211
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,760
It turns out there's a neat

212
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,470
way to pose this as a

213
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,960
Matrix Vector multiplication.

214
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,640
So, here's how I'm going to do it.

215
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,690
I am going to construct a matrix as follows.

216
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,110
My matrix is going to be

217
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,840
1111 times, and I'm

218
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:15,500
going to write down the sizes

219
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:19,860
of my four houses here and

220
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,230
I'm going to construct a vector

221
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,320
as well, And my

222
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,560
vector is going to this

223
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:30,040
vector of two elements, that's

224
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:32,160
minus 40 and 0.25.

225
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:34,540
That's these two co-efficients;

226
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:35,390
data 0 and data 1.

227
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,810
And what I am going

228
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,050
to do is to take matrix

229
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,670
and that vector and multiply them

230
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,470
together, that times is that multiplication symbol.

231
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,260
So what do I get?

232
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:46,410
Well this is a

233
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,180
four by two matrix.

234
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:51,950
This is a two by one matrix.

235
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,910
So the outcome is going

236
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,340
to be a four by one

237
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:59,160
vector, all right.

238
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,860
So, let me,

239
00:09:02,870 --> 00:09:05,300
so this is

240
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,170
going to be a 4 by

241
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:06,910
1 matrix is the outcome or

242
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,000
really a four diminsonal vector,

243
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:11,550
so let me write it as

244
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:15,460
one of my four elements in my four real numbers here.

245
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:17,180
Now it turns out and so

246
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,890
this first element of this

247
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,450
result, the way I

248
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,150
am going to get that is, I

249
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,500
am going to take this and multiply it by the vector.

250
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:29,330
And so this is going to

251
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:33,000
be -40 x

252
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:37,630
1 + 4.25 x 2104.

253
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,950
By the way, on

254
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,900
the earlier slides I was

255
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,250
writing 1 x -40 and

256
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,390
2104 x 0.25, but

257
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,570
the order doesn't matter, right?

258
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:49,620
-40 x 1 is the same as 1 x -40.

259
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:52,080
And this first element, of course,

260
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:55,120
is "H" applied to 2104.

261
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:57,290
So it's really the

262
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,940
predicted price of my first house.

263
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:02,380
Well, how about the second element?

264
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:04,030
Hope you can see

265
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,150
where I am going to get the second element.

266
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:08,140
Right?

267
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,990
I'm gonna take this and multiply it by my vector.

268
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,170
And so that's gonna be

269
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,980
-40 x 1 + 0.25 x 1416.

270
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:22,260
And so this is going be "H" of 1416.

271
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,610
Right?

272
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:26,950
And so on for the

273
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,750
third and the fourth

274
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,790
elements of this 4 x 1 vector.

275
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,110
And just there, right?

276
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,180
This thing here that I

277
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:41,100
just drew the green box around,

278
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,670
that's a real number, OK?

279
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,170
That's a single real number,

280
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,670
and this thing here that

281
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,760
I drew the magenta box around--the

282
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:49,840
purple, magenta color box

283
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:50,910
around--that's a real number, right?

284
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,660
And so this thing on

285
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,050
the right--this thing on the

286
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,210
right overall, this is a

287
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:59,190
4 by 1 dimensional matrix, was a 4 dimensional vector.

288
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,700
And, the neat thing about

289
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,120
this is that when you're

290
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:04,370
actually implementing this in software--so

291
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,340
when you have four houses and

292
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:08,370
when you want to use your hypothesis

293
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:12,290
to predict the prices, predict the price "Y" of all of these four houses.

294
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,520
What this means is that, you

295
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:16,130
know, you can write this in one line of code.

296
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,800
When we talk about octave and

297
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,780
program languages later, you can

298
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:22,080
actually, you'll actually write this in one line of code.

299
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:24,800
You write prediction equals my,

300
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:30,320
you know, data matrix times

301
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,880
parameters, right?

302
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:36,960
Where data matrix is

303
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:38,600
this thing here, and parameters

304
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:40,340
is this thing here, and this

305
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:44,070
times is a matrix vector multiplication.

306
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,790
And if you just do this then

307
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,550
this variable prediction - sorry

308
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,260
for my bad handwriting - then

309
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,880
just implement this one

310
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:52,330
line of code assuming you have

311
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:55,210
an appropriate library to do matrix vector multiplication.

312
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,480
If you just do this,

313
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:58,910
then prediction becomes this

314
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,650
4 by 1 dimensional vector, on

315
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:04,860
the right, that just gives you all the predicted prices.

316
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:07,080
And your alternative to doing

317
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:09,300
this as a matrix vector multiplication

318
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:11,220
would be to write eomething like

319
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,520
, you know, for I equals 1 to 4, right?

320
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:15,150
And you have say a thousand houses

321
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,420
it would be for I equals 1 to a thousand or whatever.

322
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:18,730
And then you have to write a

323
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:21,900
prediction, you know, if I equals.

324
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,120
and then do a bunch

325
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:25,600
more work over there and it

326
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:27,150
turns out that When you

327
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,520
have a large number of houses,

328
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:29,920
if you're trying to predict the prices

329
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:30,980
of not just four but maybe

330
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:33,400
of a thousand houses then

331
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:35,130
it turns out that when

332
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,070
you implement this in the

333
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:40,070
computer, implementing it like this, in any of the various languages.

334
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,500
This is not only true for

335
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,020
Octave, but for Supra Server

336
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:46,230
Java or Python, other high-level, other languages as well.

337
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,030
It turns out, that, by writing

338
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,760
code in this style on the

339
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,510
left, it allows you to

340
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,220
not only simplify the

341
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,640
code, because, now, you're just

342
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:55,860
writing one line of code

343
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:58,440
rather than the form of a bunch of things inside.

344
00:12:58,450 --> 00:12:59,720
But, for subtle reasons, that we

345
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:01,390
will see later, it turns

346
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,370
out to be much more computationally

347
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,510
efficient to make predictions

348
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,520
on all of the prices of

349
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:08,350
all of your houses doing it

350
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,680
the way on the left than the

351
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:13,320
way on the right than if you were to write your own formula.

352
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,510
I'll say more about this

353
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,930
later when we talk about

354
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,670
vectorization, but, so, by

355
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,100
posing a prediction this way, you

356
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,490
get not only a simpler piece

357
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,180
of code, but a more efficient one.

358
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:25,110
So, that's it for

359
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,020
matrix vector multiplication and we'll

360
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,390
make good use of these sorts

361
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,360
of operations as we develop

362
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:32,900
the living regression in other models further.

363
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:34,220
But, in the next video we're

364
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,070
going to take this and generalize this

365
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,950
to the case of matrix matrix multiplication.
