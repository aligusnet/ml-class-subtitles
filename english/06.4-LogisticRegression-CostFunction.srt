1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,670
In this video we'll talk about

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,030
how to fit the parameters theta

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,870
for logistic regression.

4
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,010
In particular, I'd like to

5
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,390
define the optimization objective or the

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,970
cost function that we'll use to fit the parameters.

7
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,360
Here's to supervised learning problem

8
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:19,950
of fitting a logistic regression model.

9
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,170
We have a training set

10
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,940
of M training examples.

11
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:26,560
And as usual each of

12
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:28,140
our examples is represented by

13
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:32,730
feature vector that's N plus 1 dimensional.

14
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:35,170
And as usual we have

15
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:36,430
X 0 equals 1.

16
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,300
Our first feature, or our 0

17
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:39,960
feature is always equal to 1,

18
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:41,170
and because this is a

19
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,340
classification problem, our training

20
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,000
set has the property that

21
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:48,390
every label Y, is either 0 or 1.

22
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,550
This is a hypothesis

23
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,950
and the parameters of the

24
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,480
hypothesis is this theta over here.

25
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:55,600
And the question I want

26
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,330
to talk about is given this

27
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:58,870
training set how do

28
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,500
we choose, or how do we fit the parameters theta?

29
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:04,100
Back when we were developing the

30
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:08,410
linear regression model, we use the following cost function.

31
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,890
I've written this slightly differently, where

32
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,660
instead of 1/2m, I've

33
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:16,340
taken the 1/2 and put it inside the summation instead.

34
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,390
Now, I want to use

35
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,130
an alternative way of writing

36
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,690
out this cost function which is

37
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,020
that instead of writing out

38
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:23,910
this squared and return here,

39
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,300
let's write here, cost of

40
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:31,490
H of X comma

41
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,590
Y, and I'm going

42
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,000
to define that term cost

43
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:39,730
of H of X comma Y to be equal to this.

44
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,660
It's just equal to just one half of the square root error.

45
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:43,730
So now, we can see more

46
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,980
clearly that the cost

47
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,100
function is a sum

48
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:49,770
over my training set, or

49
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,360
is 1/m times the sum

50
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:55,870
over my training set of this cost term here.

51
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:58,040
And to simplify this

52
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,480
equation a little bit more, it's gonna

53
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:02,600
be convenient to get rid of those superscripts.

54
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,380
So just define cost of

55
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,500
H of X comma Y to

56
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,600
be equal to 1/2 of

57
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:08,910
this square root error  and the

58
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,350
interpretation of this cost function

59
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,880
is that this is the

60
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:13,450
cost I want my learning

61
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,050
algorithm to, you know,

62
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,740
have to pay, if it

63
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,720
outputs that value it

64
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:19,880
this prediction is H of

65
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:21,300
X, and the actual

66
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:24,040
label was Y. So just

67
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:27,830
cross off those superscripts. All right.

68
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,740
And no surprise for linear

69
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,510
regression the cost for you to define is that.

70
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,740
Well the cost for this

71
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,530
is, that is 1/2

72
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,170
times the square difference

73
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,660
between what are predicted and the

74
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:38,920
actual value that we observe

75
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:41,070
for Y. Now, this cost

76
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,820
function worked fine for linear

77
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:47,420
regression, but here we're interested in logistic regression.

78
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:49,140
If we could minimize this cost

79
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:52,010
function that is plugged into J here.

80
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,770
That will work okay.

81
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,470
But it turns out that if

82
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,620
we use this particular cost function

83
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:01,810
this would be a non-convex function of the parameters theta.

84
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,980
Here's what I mean by non-convex.

85
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,300
We have some cost function J

86
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,130
of theta, and for logistic

87
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:12,060
regression this function H here

88
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:13,490
has a non linearity, right?

89
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,490
It says, you know, 1 over

90
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,350
1 plus E to the negative theta transfers

91
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,570
X. So it's a pretty complicated nonlinear function.

92
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,120
And if you take the sigmoid

93
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,050
function and plug it in

94
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,290
here and then take

95
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,010
this cost function and plug

96
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,700
it in there, and then plot

97
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,200
what J of theta looks

98
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,620
like, you find that

99
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:33,490
J of theta can look like a function just like this.

100
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,920
You know with many local optima and

101
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,330
the formal term for this

102
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,490
is that this a non convex function.

103
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,610
And you can kind of tell.

104
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,820
If you were to run gradient

105
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,150
descent on this sort of

106
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,160
function, it is not guaranteed

107
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:47,720
to converge to the global minimum.

108
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:48,860
Whereas in contrast, what

109
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,340
we would like is to have

110
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:52,090
a cost function J of theta

111
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,580
that is convex, that is

112
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,190
a single bow-shaped function that

113
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,650
looks like this, so that

114
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,520
if you run gradient descent, we

115
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,160
would be guaranteed that gradient descent, you know,

116
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:04,900
would converge to the global minimum.

117
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:07,010
And the problem of using the

118
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,510
the square cost function is that

119
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,390
because of this very

120
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,340
non linear sigmoid function that

121
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:14,090
appears in the middle here, J of

122
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,950
theta ends up being

123
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,930
a non convex function if you

124
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:21,240
were to define it as the square cost function.

125
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,310
So what we'd would like to do

126
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,780
is to instead come up with

127
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,540
a different cost function that

128
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:28,050
is convex and so

129
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,270
that we can apply a great

130
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,930
algorithm like gradient descent

131
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,630
and be guaranteed to find a global minimum.

132
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,280
Here's a cost function that we're going to use for logistic regression.

133
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,310
We're going to say the cost

134
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,660
or the penalty that the algorithm

135
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,880
pays if it outputs

136
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:44,610
a value H of X.

137
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,680
So, this is some number like 0.7

138
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:48,620
where it predicts a value H

139
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,760
of X. And the actual

140
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:52,020
cost label turns out to

141
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:54,080
be Y. The cost is

142
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:56,090
going to be minus log

143
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,850
H of X if Y is equal 1.

144
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,450
And minus log, 1 minus

145
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:02,010
H of X if Y is equal to 0.

146
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,220
This looks like a pretty complicated function.

147
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,720
But let's plot function to

148
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:08,150
gain some intuition about what it's doing.

149
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,060
Let's start up with the case of Y equals 1.

150
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,420
If Y is equal equal

151
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,820
to 1, then the cost function

152
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:18,200
is -log H of X, and

153
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:19,580
if we plot that, so let's

154
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,570
say that the horizontal

155
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,910
axis is H of X.

156
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,720
So we know that a hypothesis

157
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,620
is going to output a value between

158
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,050
0 and 1.

159
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:28,480
Right?

160
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:30,520
So H of X that varies

161
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,920
between 0 and 1.

162
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:35,460
If you plot what this cost function looks like.

163
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,900
You find that it looks like this.

164
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:38,950
One way to see why the

165
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,430
plot like this it is because

166
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,950
if you were to plot log Z

167
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,580
with Z on the horizontal axis.

168
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:48,740
Then that looks like that.

169
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,340
And it's approach is minus infinity.

170
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,660
So this is what the log function looks like.

171
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,970
And so this is 0, this is 1.

172
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,460
Here Z is of

173
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:59,640
course playing the row of

174
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,010
H of X.  And so

175
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:06,060
minus log Z will look like this.

176
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:08,090
Right just flipping the sign.

177
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,780
Minus log Z. And we're

178
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,010
interested only in the

179
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,600
range of when this function

180
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:13,950
goes between 0 and 1.

181
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,910
So, get rid of that.

182
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,970
And so, we're just left with,

183
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,440
you know, this part of the curve.

184
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,150
And that's what this curve on the left looks like.

185
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,490
Now this cost function

186
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,680
has a few interesting and desirable properties.

187
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:32,080
First you notice that if

188
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:35,000
Y is equal to 1 and H of X is equal 1, in

189
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:37,400
other words, if the hypothesis

190
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:38,980
exactly, you know, predicts

191
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,250
H equals 1, and Y

192
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,710
is exactly equal to what I predicted.

193
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,160
Then the cost is equal 0.

194
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:44,380
Right?

195
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:47,440
That corresponds to, the curve doesn't actually flatten out.

196
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,870
The curve is still going. First, notice

197
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,960
that if H of X

198
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,980
equals 1, if the hypothesis

199
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:55,060
predicts that Y is equal to 1.

200
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:56,300
And if indeed Y is

201
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,520
equal to 1 then the cost is equal to 0.

202
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,820
That corresponds to this point down here.

203
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:01,020
Right?

204
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:02,320
If H of X is equal

205
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:04,020
to 1, and we're only

206
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:06,230
concerned the case that Y equals 1 here.

207
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,340
But if H of X is equal to 1.

208
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:11,030
Then the cost is down here is equal to 0.

209
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,010
And that is what we like it to be.

210
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:13,910
Because, you know, if we

211
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,640
correctly predict the output Y then the cost is 0.

212
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:21,320
But now, notice

213
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:23,430
that H of X approaches 0.

214
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,010
So, that's H. As the

215
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,830
output of the hypothesis approaches 0

216
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,130
the cost blows up, and it goes to infinity.

217
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,500
And what this does is

218
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:34,300
it captures the intuition that if

219
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,870
a hypothesis, you know, outputs 0.

220
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,550
That's like saying, our hypothesis is

221
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,910
saying, the chance of Y

222
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,520
equals 1 is equal to 0.

223
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:42,510
It's kind of like our going

224
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,010
to our medical patient and saying,

225
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,600
"The probability that you

226
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:47,280
have a malignant tumor, the

227
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:49,840
probability that Y equals 1 is zero."

228
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:52,150
So, it's like absolutely impossible that your

229
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,140
tumor is malignant.

230
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,740
But if it turns out that

231
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:00,090
the tumor, the patient's tumor, actually is malignant.

232
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,870
So if Y is equal to

233
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,290
1 even after we told them

234
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,380
you know, the probability of it happening is 0.

235
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:08,640
It's absolutely impossible for it to be malignant.

236
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:09,750
But if we told them

237
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,230
this with that level of certainty,

238
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,990
and we turn out to be wrong,

239
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,680
then we penalize the learning algorithm

240
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:16,100
by a very, very large cost,

241
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:17,950
and that's captured by having this

242
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,440
cost goes infinity if Y

243
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:21,890
equals 1 and H

244
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,320
of X approaches 0.

245
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:26,710
This might consider of

246
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,860
Y1, let's look at what

247
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:31,810
the cost function looks like for Y0.

248
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:35,710
If Y is equal to 0, then the cost

249
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:39,100
looks like this expression over here.

250
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,390
And if you plot

251
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,770
the function minus log 1

252
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,810
minus Z what you

253
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:49,230
get is the cost function actually looks like this.

254
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,260
So, it goes from 0 to 1.

255
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:53,010
Something like that.

256
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,590
And so if you plot

257
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,840
the cost function for the case

258
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:57,760
of y equals zero, you find that it looks

259
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:00,730
like this and what

260
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,380
this curve does is it

261
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:04,910
now blows up,

262
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,280
and it goes to plus infinity as H of X goes to 1.

263
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:09,890
Because it's saying that

264
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,190
if Y turns out to be

265
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,130
equal to 0, but we

266
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,950
predicted that you know, Y is

267
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,310
equal to 1 with almost

268
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,250
certainty with probability 1, then

269
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:20,100
we end up paying a very large cost.

270
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:23,080
Let's plot the cost function for

271
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:25,030
the case of Y equals 0.

272
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,510
So if Y equals 0 that's going to be our cost function.

273
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,900
If you look at this expression,

274
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,710
and if you plot, you know, minus

275
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,210
log 1 minus Z, if

276
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,410
you figure out what that looks like,

277
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:40,040
you get a figure that looks like this.

278
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,670
Where, which goes from 0

279
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,590
to 1 with the Z

280
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,790
axis on the horizontal axis.

281
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,190
So If you take this cost

282
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,310
function and plot it for

283
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,550
the case of Y equals 0,

284
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,130
what you get is

285
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:55,070
that the cost function looks like this.

286
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,710
And what this cost function

287
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,650
does is that it blows

288
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,550
up or it goes to a

289
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,410
positive infinity as each

290
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,700
H of X goes to one

291
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,400
and this captures the

292
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:07,170
intuition that if a hypothesis

293
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,840
predicted that, you know, H of

294
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,390
X is equal to 1 with

295
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,100
certainty, with like probability 1,

296
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:14,260
it's absolutely got to be Y equals 1.

297
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,490
But if Y turned out to

298
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,170
be equal to 0 then

299
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,180
it makes sense to make the

300
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:21,930
hypothesis, or make the learning algorithm pay a very large cost.

301
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:24,600
And conversely, if H

302
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:25,940
of X is equal to

303
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,440
0 and Y equals zero,

304
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:28,990
then the hypothesis nailed it.

305
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,620
The predicted Y is equal

306
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,320
to zero and it turns

307
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:34,340
out Y is equal to zero

308
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,740
so at this point the cost

309
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:40,150
function is going to be 0.

310
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,140
In this video, we

311
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,870
have defined the cost function

312
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,310
for a single training example.

313
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,260
The topic of convexity analysis is beyond the scope of this course.

314
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,610
But it is possible to show

315
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,140
that with our particular choice

316
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:54,720
of cost function this would

317
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:57,950
give us a convex optimization problem

318
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,070
as cost function, overall cost function

319
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,450
J of theta will be

320
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,360
convex and local optima free.

321
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,670
In the next video we're going

322
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,740
to take these ideas of the

323
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,900
cost function for a single

324
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,800
training example and develop that

325
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,460
further and define the

326
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:13,770
cost function for the entire

327
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:16,040
training set, and we'll also

328
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,380
figure out a simpler way to

329
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:19,670
write it than we have been using so far.

330
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,020
And based on that will

331
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,750
work out gradient descent, and

332
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:26,120
that will give us our logistic regression algorithm.
