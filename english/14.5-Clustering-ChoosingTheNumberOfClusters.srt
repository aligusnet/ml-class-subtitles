00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,560
In this video I'd like to

2
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:03,340
talk about one last detail

3
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:05,440
of K-means clustering which is

4
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:06,760
how to choose the number of

5
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:08,280
clusters, or how to choose

6
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:10,220
the value of the parameter

7
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,380
capsule K. To be

8
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:13,750
honest, there actually isn't a

9
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,670
great way of answering this

10
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,810
or doing this automatically and

11
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,100
by far the most common way

12
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:20,510
of choosing the number of clusters,

13
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,700
is still choosing it manually

14
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:24,440
by looking at visualizations or by

15
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:27,330
looking at the output of the clustering algorithm or something else.

16
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:28,590
But I do get asked

17
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,640
this question quite a lot of

18
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:30,800
how do you choose the number of

19
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,230
clusters, and so I just want

20
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,840
to tell you know what

21
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:35,220
are peoples' current thinking on

22
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:36,730
it although, the most

23
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,170
common thing is actually to

24
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:41,630
choose the number of clusters by hand.

25
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:43,790
A large part of

26
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,380
y, it might not always

27
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,630
be easy to choose the

28
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,180
number of clusters is that

29
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:52,930
it is often generally ambiguous how many clusters there are in the data.

30
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,070
Looking at this data set

31
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,370
some of you may see

32
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,010
four clusters and that

33
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,610
would suggest using K equals 4.

34
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:00,860
Or some of you may

35
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,720
see two clusters and

36
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,860
that will suggest K equals

37
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:08,060
2 and now this may see three clusters.

38
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,810
And so, looking at the

39
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:10,910
data set like this, the

40
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,800
true number of clusters, it actually

41
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,680
seems genuinely ambiguous to me,

42
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:18,090
and I don't think there is one right answer.

43
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,240
And this is part of our supervised learning.

44
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,540
We are aren't given labels, and

45
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:24,820
so there isn't always a clear cut answer.

46
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:25,840
And this is one of the

47
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:27,330
things that makes it more difficult

48
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,150
to say, have an automatic

49
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,090
algorithm for choosing how many clusters to have.

50
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,310
When people talk about ways of

51
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,830
choosing the number of clusters,

52
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,430
one method that people sometimes

53
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,620
talk about is something called the Elbow Method.

54
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:40,790
Let me just tell you a little bit about that,

55
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,680
and then mention some of its advantages but also shortcomings.

56
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:46,410
So the Elbow Method,

57
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,330
what we're going to do is vary

58
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,240
K, which is the total number of clusters.

59
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,040
So, we're going to run K-means

60
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,620
with one cluster, that means really,

61
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:54,970
everything gets grouped into a

62
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,650
single cluster and compute the

63
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,450
cost function or compute the distortion

64
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:00,400
J and plot that here.

65
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:01,300
And then we're going to run K

66
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,600
means with two clusters, maybe

67
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:06,130
with multiple random initial agents, maybe not.

68
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,270
But then, you know,

69
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,490
with two clusters we should

70
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,700
get, hopefully, a smaller distortion,

71
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,940
and so plot that there.

72
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:13,300
And then run K-means with three

73
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,750
clusters, hopefully, you get even

74
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,980
smaller distortion and plot that there.

75
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:19,770
I'm gonna run K-means with four, five and so on.

76
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:20,960
And so we end up with

77
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:23,230
a curve showing how the

78
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,790
distortion, you know, goes

79
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,430
down as we increase the number of clusters.

80
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,370
And so we get a curve that maybe looks like this.

81
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:32,290
And if you look at this

82
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,710
curve, what the Elbow Method does

83
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,440
it says "Well, let's look at this plot.

84
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:40,220
Looks like there's a clear elbow there".

85
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,820
Right, this is, would be by

86
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,540
analogy to the human arm where,

87
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,360
you know, if you imagine that

88
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,230
you reach out your arm,

89
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,150
then, this is your

90
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,540
shoulder joint, this is your

91
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:53,250
elbow joint and I guess, your hand is at the end over here.

92
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,480
And so this is the Elbow Method.

93
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:56,240
Then you find this sort of pattern

94
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,540
where the distortion goes down rapidly

95
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,270
from 1 to 2, and 2 to

96
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,510
3, and then you reach an

97
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,320
elbow at 3, and then

98
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,420
the distortion goes down very slowly after that.

99
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,570
And then it looks like, you

100
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,950
know what, maybe using three

101
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,030
clusters is the right

102
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,010
number of clusters, because that's

103
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,690
the elbow of this curve, right?

104
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,240
That it goes down, distortion goes

105
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,600
down rapidly until K equals

106
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:19,810
3, really goes down very slowly after that.

107
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,350
So let's pick K equals 3.

108
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,100
If you apply the Elbow Method,

109
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,530
and if you get a plot

110
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,880
that actually looks like this,

111
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,230
then, that's pretty good, and

112
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,690
this would be a reasonable way

113
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,610
of choosing the number of clusters.

114
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,030
It turns out the Elbow Method

115
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,330
isn't used that often, and one

116
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,340
reason is that, if you

117
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,710
actually use this on

118
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,200
a clustering problem, it turns out that

119
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:42,730
fairly often, you know,

120
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:43,900
you end up with a curve

121
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:47,690
that looks much more ambiguous, maybe something like this.

122
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,910
And if you look at this,

123
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,380
I don't know, maybe there's

124
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,710
no clear elbow, but it

125
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,430
looks like distortion continuously goes down,

126
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,610
maybe 3 is a

127
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,740
good number, maybe 4 is

128
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:58,380
a good number, maybe 5 is also not bad.

129
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:59,590
And so, if you actually

130
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,810
do this in a practice, you know,

131
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,390
if your plot looks like the one on the left and that's great.

132
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,480
It gives you a clear answer, but

133
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:06,730
just as often, you end

134
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,740
up with a plot that looks

135
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,100
like the one on the right and

136
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:11,780
is not clear where the

137
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,480
ready location of the elbow

138
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:14,630
is. It  makes it harder to

139
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,360
choose a number of clusters using this method.

140
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:18,690
So maybe the quick summary

141
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,000
of the Elbow Method is that is worth the shot

142
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,600
but I wouldn't necessarily,

143
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:24,860
you know, have a very high

144
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:28,860
expectation of it working for any particular problem.

145
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,290
Finally, here's one other way

146
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,980
of how, thinking about how

147
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,920
you choose the value of K,

148
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,300
very often people are running

149
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,520
K-means in order you

150
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:39,230
get clusters for some later

151
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,450
purpose, or for some sort of downstream purpose.

152
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,370
Maybe you want to use K-means

153
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,300
in order to do market segmentation,

154
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:48,130
like in the T-shirt sizing example that we talked about.

155
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:51,120
Maybe you want K-means to organize

156
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:52,470
a computer cluster better, or

157
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,620
maybe a learning cluster for some

158
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,440
different purpose, and so,

159
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:57,500
if that later, downstream purpose,

160
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,170
such as market segmentation. If

161
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,300
that gives you an evaluation metric,

162
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,790
then often, a better

163
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,950
way to determine the number of

164
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,000
clusters, is to see

165
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,920
how well different numbers of

166
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:11,220
clusters serve that later downstream purpose.

167
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:14,180
Let me step through a specific example.

168
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,430
Let me go through the T-shirt

169
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,560
size example again, and I'm

170
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:20,320
trying to decide, do I want three T-shirt sizes?

171
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,550
So, I choose K equals 3, then

172
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,310
I might have small, medium and large T-shirts.

173
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,460
Or maybe, I want to choose

174
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,020
K equals 5, and then I

175
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,380
might have, you know, extra

176
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:33,610
small, small, medium, large

177
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,850
and extra large T-shirt sizes.

178
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:39,260
So, you can have like 3 T-shirt sizes or four or five T-shirt sizes.

179
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,420
We could also have four T-shirt

180
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,920
sizes, but I'm just

181
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,480
showing three and five here,

182
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:46,920
just to simplify this slide for now.

183
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,120
So, if I run K-means with

184
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:50,660
K equals 3, maybe I end

185
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:53,090
up with, that's my small

186
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,130
and that's my

187
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:58,220
medium and that's my large.

188
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,640
Whereas, if I run K-means with

189
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:03,690
5 clusters, maybe I

190
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,320
end up with, those are

191
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,730
my extra small T-shirts, these

192
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:11,040
are my small, these are

193
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:13,980
my medium, these are my

194
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:18,610
large and these are my extra large.

195
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,310
And the nice thing about this

196
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,800
example is that, this then

197
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:23,540
maybe gives us another way

198
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,960
to choose whether we want

199
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:27,570
3 or 4 or 5 clusters,

200
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:29,720
and in particular, what you can

201
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:30,800
do is, you know, think

202
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:32,370
about this from the perspective

203
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,310
of the T-shirt business and

204
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,610
ask: "Well if I have

205
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:38,050
five segments, then how well

206
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,770
will my T-shirts fit my

207
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,410
customers and so, how many T-shirts can I sell?

208
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,540
How happy will my customers be?"

209
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,070
What really makes sense, from the

210
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,580
perspective of the T-shirt business,

211
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:49,510
in terms of whether, I

212
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,980
want to have Goer T-shirt sizes

213
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:54,960
so that my T-shirts fit my customers better.

214
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,350
Or do I want to have fewer

215
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,400
T-shirt sizes so that

216
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,600
I make fewer sizes of T-shirts.

217
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:02,830
And I can sell them to the customers more cheaply.

218
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,030
And so, the t-shirt selling

219
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,650
business, that might give you

220
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:10,760
a way to decide, between three clusters versus five clusters.

221
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,470
So, that gives you an

222
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,120
example of how a

223
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:16,000
later downstream purpose like

224
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:17,380
the problem of deciding what

225
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,370
T-shirts to manufacture, how that

226
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:22,890
can give you an evaluation metric for choosing the number of clusters.

227
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,870
For those of you that are

228
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,660
doing the program exercises, if

229
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:27,280
you look at this week's

230
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:29,780
program exercise associative K-means, that's

231
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:32,900
an example there of using K-means for image compression.

232
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,060
And so if you were trying to

233
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,400
choose how many clusters

234
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:37,250
to use for that problem, you could

235
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,020
also, again use the

236
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,880
evaluation metric of image compression

237
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:43,120
to choose the number of clusters, K?

238
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:43,990
So, how good do you want the

239
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,670
image to look versus, how much

240
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,960
do you want to compress the file

241
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,600
size of the image, and,

242
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:50,040
you know, if you do the

243
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,150
programming exercise, what I've just

244
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,750
said will make more sense at that time.

245
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,580
So, just summarize, for the

246
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:58,020
most part, the number of

247
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:00,140
customers K is still chosen

248
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:02,790
by hand by human input or human insight.

249
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,940
One way to try to

250
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,160
do so is to use

251
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:06,510
the Elbow Method, but I

252
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,750
wouldn't always expect that to

253
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,810
work well, but I think

254
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,960
the better way to think about

255
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:10,910
how to choose the number of

256
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,510
clusters is to ask, for

257
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,390
what purpose are you running K-means?

258
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:16,820
And then to think, what is

259
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,340
the number of clusters K that

260
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:19,660
serves that, you know, whatever

261
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:23,210
later purpose that you actually run the K-means for.
