00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:01,580
In this video, I want to

2
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:02,870
tell you about a couple of special

3
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,820
matrix operations, called the

4
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,730
matrix inverse and the matrix transpose operation.

5
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:10,300
Let's start by talking about matrix

6
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:12,930
inverse, and as

7
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,490
usual we'll start by thinking about

8
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,270
how it relates to real numbers.

9
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,780
In the last video, I said

10
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:20,570
that the number one plays the

11
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,580
role of the identity in

12
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:26,060
the space of real numbers because

13
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,850
one times anything is equal to itself.

14
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,220
It turns out that real numbers

15
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,600
have this property that very

16
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:33,110
number have an, that

17
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,580
each number has an inverse,

18
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,650
for example, given the number

19
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,470
three, there exists some

20
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,100
number, which happens to

21
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,510
be three inverse so that

22
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,780
that number times gives you

23
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:46,470
back the identity element one.

24
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,700
And so to me, inverse of course this is just one third.

25
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:53,380
And given some other number,

26
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:55,340
maybe twelve there is

27
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,330
some number which is the

28
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,440
inverse of twelve written as

29
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:01,470
twelve to the minus one, or

30
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,080
really this is just one twelve.

31
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:07,040
So that when you multiply these two things together.

32
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:09,260
the product is equal to

33
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:12,360
the identity element one again.

34
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:13,850
Now it turns out that in

35
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,050
the space of real numbers, not everything has an inverse.

36
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:19,150
For example the number zero

37
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,950
does not have an inverse, right?

38
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,450
Because zero's a zero inverse, one over zero that's undefined.

39
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:29,900
Like this one over zero is not well defined.

40
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,440
And what we want to

41
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:32,410
do, in the rest of this

42
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:33,770
slide, is figure out what does

43
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,410
it mean to compute the inverse of a matrix.

44
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:41,740
Here's the idea: If

45
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,190
A is a end by

46
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,040
end matrix, and it

47
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:46,340
has an inverse, I will say

48
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,470
a bit more about that later, then

49
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,880
the inverse is going to

50
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,650
be written A to the

51
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:54,330
minus one and A

52
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,760
times this inverse, A to

53
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,040
the minus one, is going to

54
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,320
equal to A inverse times

55
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:00,670
A, is going to

56
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,000
give us back the identity matrix.

57
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:04,510
Okay?

58
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,050
Only matrices that are

59
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,860
m by m for some the idea of M having inverse.

60
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,640
So, a matrix is

61
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:13,030
M by M, this is also

62
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,030
called a square matrix and

63
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,170
it's called square because

64
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:24,800
the number of rows is equal to the number of columns.

65
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,520
Right and it turns out

66
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:29,510
only square matrices have inverses,

67
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,970
so A is a square

68
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,010
matrix, is m by m,

69
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:37,330
on inverse this equation over here.

70
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,730
Let's look at a concrete example,

71
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,570
so let's say I

72
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,110
have a matrix, three, four,

73
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,290
two, sixteen.

74
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,520
So this is a two by

75
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:51,800
two matrix, so it's

76
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,150
a square matrix and so this

77
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,470
may just could have an and

78
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,740
it turns out that I

79
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,300
happen to know the inverse

80
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,830
of this matrix is zero point

81
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,660
four, minus zero point

82
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,510
one, minus zero point

83
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:08,740
zero five, zero zero seven five.

84
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,230
And if I take this matrix

85
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,240
and multiply these together it

86
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,610
turns out what I get

87
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,560
is the two by

88
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,340
two identity matrix, I,

89
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:20,450
this is I two by two.

90
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:20,980
Okay?

91
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:22,290
And so on this slide,

92
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,350
you know this matrix is

93
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,160
the matrix A, and this matrix is the matrix A-inverse.

94
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:28,610
And it turns out

95
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,770
if that you are computing A

96
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,400
times A-inverse, it turns out

97
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:32,740
if you compute A-inverse times

98
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,890
A you also get back the identity matrix.

99
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,590
So how did I

100
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,910
find this inverse or how

101
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,720
did I come up with this inverse over here?

102
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:45,050
It turns out that sometimes

103
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,750
you can compute inverses by hand

104
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,770
but almost no one does that these days.

105
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,830
And it turns out there is

106
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,230
very good numerical software for

107
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,450
taking a matrix and computing its inverse.

108
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,280
So again, this is one of

109
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,270
those things where there are lots

110
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,410
of open source libraries that

111
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,730
you can link to from any

112
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:04,980
of the popular programming languages to compute inverses of matrices.

113
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,890
Let me show you a quick example.

114
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,930
How I actually computed this inverse,

115
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:12,740
and what I did was I used software called Optive.

116
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,420
So let me bring that up.

117
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:17,170
We will see a lot about Optive later.

118
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,900
Let me just quickly show you an example.

119
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:21,050
Set my matrix A to

120
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,200
be equal to that matrix on

121
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:24,400
the left, type three four

122
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:28,060
two sixteen, so that's my matrix A right.

123
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,870
This is matrix 34,

124
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,150
216 that I have down

125
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,750
here on the left.

126
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,510
And, the software lets me compute

127
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,240
the inverse of A very easily.

128
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,160
It's like P over A equals this.

129
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,750
And so, this is right,

130
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,890
this matrix here on my

131
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,690
four minus, on my one, and so on.

132
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,340
This given the numerical

133
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:46,780
solution to what is the

134
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,310
inverse of A. So let me

135
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,530
just write, inverse of A

136
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,570
equals P inverse of

137
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:55,210
A over that I

138
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,120
can now just verify that A

139
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,570
times A inverse the identity

140
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:00,620
is, type A times the

141
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:03,410
inverse of A and

142
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,740
the result of that is

143
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,500
this matrix and this is

144
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,730
one one on the diagonal

145
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:10,390
and essentially ten to

146
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,540
the minus seventeen, ten to the

147
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,290
minus sixteen, so Up to

148
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,850
numerical precision, up to

149
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:15,980
a little bit of round off

150
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,550
error that my computer

151
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,190
had in finding optimal matrices

152
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,580
and these numbers off the

153
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,960
diagonals are essentially zero

154
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:29,090
so A times the inverse is essentially the identity matrix.

155
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,890
Can also verify the inverse of

156
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,170
A times A is also

157
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,770
equal to the identity,

158
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:38,160
ones on the diagonals and values

159
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,870
that are essentially zero except

160
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,830
for a little bit of round

161
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,160
dot error on the off diagonals.

162
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,370
If a definition that the inverse

163
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,280
of a matrix is, I had

164
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:50,280
this caveat first it must

165
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:52,400
always be a square matrix, it

166
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:54,180
had this caveat, that if

167
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:57,200
A has an inverse, exactly what

168
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:58,800
matrices have an inverse

169
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:00,190
is beyond the scope of this

170
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,030
linear algebra for review that one

171
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,890
intuition you might take away

172
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,250
that just as the

173
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,520
number zero doesn't have an

174
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,430
inverse, it turns out

175
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,150
that if A is say the

176
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,430
matrix of all zeros, then

177
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,760
this matrix A also does

178
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:16,420
not have an inverse because there's

179
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,030
no matrix there's no A

180
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,800
inverse matrix so that this

181
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,120
matrix times some other

182
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,160
matrix will give you the

183
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:23,730
identity matrix so this matrix of

184
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,220
all zeros, and there

185
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:27,640
are a few other matrices with properties similar to this.

186
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:31,110
That also don't have an inverse.

187
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,460
But it turns out that

188
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:33,590
in this review I don't

189
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,580
want to go too deeply into what

190
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:37,050
it means matrix have an

191
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,750
inverse but it turns

192
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,990
out for our machine learning

193
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,820
application this shouldn't be

194
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:44,270
an issue or more precisely

195
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,350
for the learning algorithms where

196
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,960
this may be an to namely

197
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:49,220
whether or not an inverse matrix

198
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,950
appears and I will tell when

199
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,680
we get to those learning algorithms

200
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:53,750
just what it means for an

201
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,140
algorithm to have or not

202
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:57,990
have an inverse and how to fix it in case.

203
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,740
Working with matrices that don't

204
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:01,300
have inverses.

205
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,870
But the intuition if you

206
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,210
want is that you can

207
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,730
think of matrices as not

208
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:07,290
have an inverse that is somehow

209
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,820
too close to zero in some sense.

210
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,660
So, just to wrap

211
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:15,090
up the terminology, matrix that

212
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,930
don't have an inverse Sometimes called

213
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,790
a singular matrix or degenerate

214
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,960
matrix and so this

215
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,620
matrix over here is an

216
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:24,690
example zero zero zero matrix.

217
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:29,160
is an example of a matrix that is singular, or a matrix that is degenerate.

218
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,360
Finally, the last special

219
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:32,630
matrix operation I want to

220
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,520
tell you about is to do matrix transpose.

221
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:36,390
So suppose I have

222
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,200
matrix A, if I compute

223
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:41,330
the transpose of A, that's what I get here on the right.

224
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,020
This is a transpose which is

225
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:46,330
written and A superscript T,

226
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,400
and the way you compute

227
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,510
the transpose of a matrix is as follows.

228
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,600
To get a transpose I am going

229
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:52,290
to first take the first

230
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,070
row of A one to zero.

231
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,830
That becomes this first column of this transpose.

232
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,720
And then I'm going to take

233
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:00,900
the second row of A,

234
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:04,420
3 5 9, and that becomes the second column.

235
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:06,800
of the matrix A transpose.

236
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:08,080
And another way of

237
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:10,280
thinking about how the computer transposes

238
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,560
is as if you're taking this

239
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:14,630
sort of 45 degree axis

240
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,300
and you are mirroring or you

241
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:21,060
are flipping the matrix along that 45 degree axis.

242
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,490
so here's the more formal

243
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,330
definition of a matrix transpose.

244
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:30,880
Let's say A is a m by n matrix.

245
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,610
And let's let B equal A

246
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:36,040
transpose and so BA transpose like so.

247
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,460
Then B is going to

248
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:39,510
be a n by m matrix

249
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,820
with the dimensions reversed so

250
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:46,360
here we have a 2x3 matrix.

251
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:48,180
And so the transpose becomes a

252
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:51,200
3x2 matrix, and moreover,

253
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:54,600
the BIJ is equal to AJI.

254
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,210
So the IJ element of this

255
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,520
matrix B is going to be

256
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:59,890
the JI element of that

257
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,260
earlier matrix A. So for

258
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:04,200
example, B 1 2

259
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,930
is going to be equal

260
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,610
to, look at this

261
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,500
matrix, B 1 2 is going to be equal to

262
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:13,790
this element 3 1st row, 2nd column.

263
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,000
And that equal to this, which

264
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:18,210
is a two one, second

265
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:21,410
row first column, right, which

266
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,430
is equal to two and some

267
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,840
of the example B 3

268
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:28,500
2, right, that's B

269
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,920
3 2 is this element 9,

270
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:33,260
and that's equal to

271
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:35,500
a two three which is

272
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:38,740
this element up here, nine.

273
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:40,330
And so that wraps up

274
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,850
the definition of what it

275
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,500
means to take the transpose

276
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,920
of a matrix and that

277
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:49,290
in fact concludes our linear algebra review.

278
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,650
So by now hopefully you know

279
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,170
how to add and subtract

280
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,630
matrices as well as

281
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,260
multiply them and you

282
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:57,080
also know how, what are

283
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:58,920
the definitions of the inverses

284
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:01,400
and transposes of a matrix

285
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:02,850
and these are the main operations

286
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,120
used in linear algebra

287
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,110
for this course.

288
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,960
In case this is the first time you are seeing this material.

289
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:10,760
I know this was a lot

290
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:13,000
of linear algebra material all presented

291
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:14,510
very quickly and it's a

292
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,530
lot to absorb but

293
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,050
if you there's no need

294
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,020
to memorize all the definitions

295
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,670
we just went through and if

296
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,410
you download the copy of either

297
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,530
these slides or of the

298
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:28,360
lecture notes from the course website.

299
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:29,580
and use either the slides or

300
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,480
the lecture notes as a reference

301
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:32,890
then you can always refer back

302
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,120
to the definitions and to figure

303
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:35,580
out what are these matrix

304
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:39,130
multiplications, transposes and so on definitions.

305
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,660
And the lecture notes on the course website also

306
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,440
has pointers to additional

307
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:44,640
resources linear algebra which

308
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:48,330
you can use to learn more about linear algebra by yourself.

309
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:53,530
And next with these new tools.

310
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,090
We'll be able in the next

311
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,980
few videos to develop more colorful

312
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,740
forms of linear regression that

313
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,770
can view of a lot

314
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,780
more data, a lot more

315
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,210
features, a lot more training

316
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,390
examples and later on

317
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,060
after the new regression we'll actually

318
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,820
continue using these linear

319
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:09,760
algebra tools to derive more

320
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:13,280
powerful learning algorithims as well
