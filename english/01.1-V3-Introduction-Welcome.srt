1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,200
Welcome to this free online class on Machine Learning.

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:04,440
Machine Learning is one of

3
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:06,420
the most exciting recent technologies and

4
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:07,860
in this class, you learn about

5
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:09,480
the state of the art and also

6
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:13,140
gain practice implementing at the point these algorithms yourself.

7
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:14,410
You probably used a learning

8
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:17,380
algorithm dozens of times a day without knowing it.

9
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:18,340
Every time you use a web

10
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:21,240
search engine, like Google or Bing to search the internet.

11
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,540
One of the reasons that it works so

12
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:24,010
well is because a learning

13
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,750
algorithm when implemented by

14
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,360
Google or Microsoft has learned how to rank what pages.

15
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:32,760
Every time you use Facebook or

16
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:34,760
Apple's photo tagging application and

17
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:37,030
it recognizes your friend's photos,

18
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,580
that's also Machine Learning.

19
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,280
Every time you read your email and your spam

20
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:43,850
filter saves you from having

21
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,090
to wade through tons of spam email.

22
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,000
That's also a learning algorithm.

23
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,840
For me, one of the

24
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,120
reasons I am excited is

25
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:53,580
the AI dream of some

26
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,300
day building machines as intelligent

27
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:56,740
as you are.

28
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,370
We are a long way away from that goal.

29
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,340
But many AI researchers believe that

30
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:01,770
the best way towards that goal

31
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,570
is through learning algorithms. They try

32
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:06,130
to mimic how the human brain

33
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:07,880
learns.

34
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,340
I'll tell you a little bit about that too in this class.

In this class, you learn about state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms.

35
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:14,640
But it turns out, just knowing

36
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:17,700
the algorithms and knowing the math is not that much good.

37
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,430
If you don't also know how

38
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,380
to actually get this stuff to

39
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:22,980
work on problems that you care about.

40
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:26,530
So we have also spent a lot of time developing exercises

41
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:27,850
for you to implement each of these

42
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:31,160
algorithms and see how they work with yourself.

43
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:34,810
So why is machine learning so prevalent today?

44
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,410
It turns out that Machine Learning

45
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,690
is a few that have grown

46
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,580
out of field of AI or Artificial Intelligence.

47
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,370
We wanted to build intelligent machines

48
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,130
and it turns out that there

49
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,130
are a few basic thing we could program

50
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,570
a machine to do such as

51
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,930
how to find the shortest path

52
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,780
from A to B.  But for

53
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:52,930
the most part, we just did

54
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,090
not know how to write

55
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,430
AI programs to do the

56
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,100
more interesting things such as

57
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:00,860
web search or photo tagging or email anti-spam.

58
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,490
There is a realization that

59
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,480
the only way to do these

60
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:07,270
things was to have a machine learn to do it by yourself.

61
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,410
So, Machine Learning was

62
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,350
developed as a new capability for computers.

63
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,030
And today it touches many

64
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,090
segments of industry and basic science.

65
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,360
For me, I work on

66
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:19,680
Machine Learning and in a

67
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:21,210
typical week, I might end

68
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,880
up talking to helicopter

69
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,540
pilots, biologists, a bunch of

70
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:28,050
computer systems people and so are like my colleagues here at Stanford.

71
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,450
And averaging two or three

72
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,460
times a week, I would get

73
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,300
email from people in industry, from

74
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,110
Silicon Valley, contacting me

75
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,560
who have an interest in applying

76
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:38,230
learning algorithms to their own problems.

77
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,200
This is a sign of the

78
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,780
range of problems that Machine Learning

79
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:43,050
touches: the isotonic bodies,

80
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,980
composition biology, tons of

81
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,580
things of Silicon Valley that

82
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,870
Machine Learning is having an

83
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,860
impact on.

84
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,630
Here are some modern examples of Machine Learning.

85
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,400
There's database mining.

86
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,110
One of the reasons Machine Learning

87
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,050
is so prevalent is the growth of the web and the growth of automation.

88
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:05,020
All this means that we have much larger data assessment then ever before.

89
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,720
So, for example, tons of

90
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:08,510
Silicon Valley companies are today

91
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,640
collecting web click data, also

92
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,370
called click stream data, and I'm

93
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,180
trying to use Machine Learning algorithms

94
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:16,230
to mine this data to understand

95
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,650
the users better and to serve the users better.

96
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:22,170
There's a huge segment of Silicon Valley right now.

97
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,120
Medical records, with the

98
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,660
advent of automation, we now

99
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:28,150
have electronic medical records so

100
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,930
if we can turn medical records

101
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,670
into medical knowledge, then we

102
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,340
can start understand disease better.

103
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:37,450
Computational biology. We've automationally gained.

104
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,890
Biologists are collecting once

105
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,750
the data about gene sequences,

106
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,900
DNA sequences and so on.

107
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,540
And Machine Learning algorithms are giving

108
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,210
us a much better understanding of

109
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,830
the human genome and what

110
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,860
it means to be human, and in engineering as well.

111
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,360
In all fields of engineering we

112
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:53,940
have larger and larger, larger and

113
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,960
larger data sets that we're trying to understanding using learning algorithms.

114
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:59,200
A second range of

115
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:01,290
Machine Learning applications is ones

116
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,910
that we can not program by hand.

117
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,120
So, for example, I've worked on

118
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:07,130
autonomous helicopters for many years.

119
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,310
We just did not know how to

120
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,800
write a computer program to make this helicopter fly by itself.

121
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,250
The only thing that worked was

122
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,340
how the computer learn by

123
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:20,870
itself how to fly

124
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:25,800
this helicopter.

125
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,500
Handwriting recognition.

126
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,590
It turns out, one of the

127
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,920
reasons it's so inexpensive today

128
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,120
to route a piece of mail

129
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:45,270
across the country in the

130
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,830
US and internationally is that

131
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,100
when you write an envelope like

132
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,510
this, it turns out there's

133
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,940
is a learning algorithm that has

134
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:54,090
learned how to read your handwriting

135
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,970
so that it can automatically route this envelope on its way.

136
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,300
So it costs us

137
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:01,730
a few cents to send this thing thousands of miles.

138
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:04,910
And in fact, if you've seen the fields of

139
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,920
natural language processing or

140
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:08,360
computer vision, you saw

141
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:10,140
the use of AI pertaining

142
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:13,080
to understanding language or understanding images.

143
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:14,830
Most of natural language processing, most

144
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:19,090
of computer vision today is applied to machine learning.

145
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:24,310
Learning algorithms are also widely used for self-customizing programs.

146
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,760
Every time you go to Amazon

147
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:28,050
or Netflix or iTunes Genius and

148
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,920
it recommends movies or products

149
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,470
of music to you that's a learning algorithm.

150
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,100
If you think about it'd have a million users.

151
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,390
There is no way to write a

152
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,030
million different programs for the million users.

153
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,150
The only way to have

154
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,750
software get these customized recommendations

155
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,400
is if it can learn by itself

156
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:48,150
to customize itself to your preferences.

157
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,060
Finally, learning algorithms are being

158
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,160
used today to understand

159
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:55,090
human learning and to understand the brain.

160
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,390
We'll talk about how researchers are

161
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,980
using this to make progress

162
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,630
towards the big eon dream.

163
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,150
A few months ago, a student

164
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,710
showed me an article on the top 12 IT skills.

165
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,990
The skills that information technology hiring

166
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,060
managers cannot say no to.

167
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,740
It's a slightly older article, but at

168
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,490
the top of this list

169
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,000
of the 12 most desirable IT skills

170
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,580
was the machine learning.

171
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:18,960
Here at Stanford, the number

172
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:20,640
of recruiters that contact me

173
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,190
asking if I know any graduating

174
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,970
e-learning students is far

175
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,290
larger than the number of

176
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,760
Machine Learning students that we gradually hear.

177
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,370
So I think there's a vast unfulfilled

178
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,660
demand for the skill set, and this

179
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:32,530
is a great time to be

180
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,230
learning about Machine Learning and I

181
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,900
hope to teach you a lot about Machine Learning in this class.

182
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:39,100
In the next video we'll start

183
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,050
to give a formal definition of

184
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,640
what is Machine Learning and we'll

185
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:44,100
begin to talk about the main

186
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:46,850
types of Machine Learning problems and algorithms. You

187
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,850
pick up some of the main

188
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,880
Machine Learning terminology and start

189
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:50,970
to get a sense of what

190
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:54,990
are the different algorithms and when each one might be appropriate.
