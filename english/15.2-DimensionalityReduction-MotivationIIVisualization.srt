1
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,460
In the last video, we talked

2
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:03,520
about dimensionality reduction for

3
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:05,820
the purpose of compressing the data.

4
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:06,900
In this video, I'd like

5
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:08,860
to tell you about a second application

6
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:13,430
of dimensionality reduction and that is to visualize the data.

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,550
For a lot of machine learning

8
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,210
applications, it really helps

9
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:17,980
us to develop effective learning

10
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:20,600
algorithms, if we can understand our data better.

11
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:22,090
If there is some way of visualizing

12
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,070
the data better, and so,

13
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,980
dimensionality reduction offers us,

14
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:28,690
often, another useful tool to do so.

15
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,790
Let's start with an example.

16
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,710
Let's say we've collected a large

17
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,830
data set of many statistics

18
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,020
and facts about different countries around the world.

19
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,080
So, maybe the first feature, X1

20
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:39,710
is the country's GDP, or the

21
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,840
Gross Domestic Product, and

22
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,590
X2 is a per capita, meaning

23
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,070
the per person GDP, X3

24
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,520
human development index, life

25
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:51,550
expectancy, X5, X6 and so on.

26
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,870
And we may have a huge data set

27
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,280
like this, where, you know,

28
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:57,640
maybe 50 features for

29
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:01,160
every country, and we have a huge set of countries.

30
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:02,800
So is there something

31
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:05,480
we can do to try to understand our data better?

32
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:07,840
I've given this huge table of numbers.

33
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:11,500
How do you visualize this data?

34
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:12,590
If you have 50 features, it's

35
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,470
very difficult to plot 50-dimensional

36
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:16,460
data.

37
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:20,560
What is a good way to examine this data?

38
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,950
Using dimensionality reduction, what

39
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,190
we can do is, instead of

40
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,420
having each country represented by

41
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:30,450
this featured vector, xi, which

42
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:33,400
is 50-dimensional, so instead

43
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:35,320
of, say, having a country

44
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:37,370
like Canada, instead of

45
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,310
having 50 numbers to represent the features

46
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,230
of Canada, let's say we

47
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,890
can come up with a different feature

48
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,310
representation that is these

49
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,150
z vectors, that is in R2.

50
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,900
If that's the case, if we

51
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,220
can have just a pair of

52
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,780
numbers, z1 and z2 that

53
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,630
somehow, summarizes my 50

54
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,800
numbers, maybe what we

55
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,180
can do  [xx] is to plot

56
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,960
these countries in R2 and

57
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,580
use that to try to

58
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:03,940
understand the space in

59
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,890
[xx] of features of different

60
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:08,510
countries [xx]  the better and

61
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,770
so, here, what you

62
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,060
can do is reduce the

63
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:14,840
data from 50

64
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:17,460
D, from 50 dimensions

65
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,730
to 2D, so you can

66
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,160
plot this as a 2

67
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,600
dimensional plot, and, when

68
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:23,260
you do that, it turns out

69
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,270
that, if you look at the

70
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,710
output of the Dimensionality Reduction algorithms,

71
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,910
It usually doesn't astride a

72
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,700
physical meaning to these new features you want [xx] to.

73
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:36,710
It's often up to us to figure out you know, roughly what these features means.

74
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,740
But, And if you plot those features, here is what you might find.

75
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,750
So, here, every country

76
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,810
is represented by a point

77
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:44,980
ZI, which is an R2

78
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,780
and so each of those.

79
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,040
Dots, and this figure

80
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,190
represents a country, and so,

81
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,190
here's Z1 and here's

82
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,080
Z2, and [xx] [xx] of these.

83
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,670
So, you might find,

84
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,680
for example, That the horizontial

85
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:00,260
axis the Z1 axis

86
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,250
corresponds roughly to the

87
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,220
overall country size, or

88
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:07,790
the overall economic activity of a country.

89
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,740
So the overall GDP, overall

90
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:14,340
economic size of a country.

91
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:15,910
Whereas the vertical axis in our

92
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,380
data might correspond to the

93
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:22,280
per person GDP.

94
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,150
Or the per person well being,

95
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:31,020
or the per person economic activity, and,

96
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,560
you might find that, given these

97
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,030
50 features, you know, these

98
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,790
are really the 2 main dimensions

99
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,160
of the deviation, and so, out

100
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:39,810
here you may have a country

101
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,490
like the U.S.A., which

102
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,680
is a relatively large GDP,

103
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,260
you know, is a very

104
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:46,700
large GDP and a relatively

105
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:49,460
high per-person GDP as well.

106
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,400
Whereas here you might have

107
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:53,960
a country like Singapore, which

108
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:55,380
actually has a very

109
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:57,020
high per person GDP as well,

110
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,090
but because Singapore is a much

111
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,020
smaller country the overall

112
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,450
economy size of Singapore

113
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:06,260
is much smaller than the US.

114
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:08,280
And, over here, you would

115
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:12,010
have countries where individuals

116
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,420
are unfortunately some are less

117
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:15,810
well off, maybe shorter life expectancy,

118
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,280
less health care, less economic

119
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:19,690
maturity that's why smaller

120
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,270
countries, whereas a point

121
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,440
like this will correspond to

122
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,150
a country that has a

123
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,080
fair, has a substantial amount of

124
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:30,510
economic activity, but where individuals

125
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,590
tend to be somewhat less well off.

126
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,830
So you might find that

127
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,670
the axes Z1 and Z2

128
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,660
can help you to most succinctly

129
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:39,110
capture really what are the

130
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,350
two main dimensions of the variations

131
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,420
amongst different countries.

132
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,390
Such as the overall economic

133
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,380
activity of the country projected

134
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,080
by the size of the

135
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:51,310
country's overall economy as well

136
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,030
as the per-person individual

137
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,790
well-being, measured by per-person

138
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,970
GDP, per-person healthcare, and things like that.

139
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:02,280
So that's how you can

140
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:04,530
use dimensionality reduction, in

141
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,460
order to reduce data from

142
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:08,140
50 dimensions or whatever, down

143
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,670
to two dimensions, or maybe

144
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,370
down to three dimensions, so that

145
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:14,830
you can plot it and understand your data better.

146
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,430
In the next video, we'll start

147
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,190
to develop a specific algorithm,

148
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,000
called PCA, or Principal Component

149
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:21,540
Analysis, which will allow

150
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,810
us to do this and also

151
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:28,190
do the earlier application I talked about of compressing the data.
