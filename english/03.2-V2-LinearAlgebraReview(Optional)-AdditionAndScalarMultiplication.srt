1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:01,560
In this video we'll talk about

2
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:03,970
matrix addition and subtraction,

3
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:05,140
as well as how to

4
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:06,680
multiply a matrix by a

5
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:10,080
number, also called Scalar Multiplication.

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,610
Let's start an example.

7
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:14,930
Given two matrices like these,

8
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,660
let's say I want to add them together.

9
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:17,640
How do I do that?

10
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:20,440
And so, what does addition of matrices mean?

11
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:21,600
It turns out that if you

12
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:24,280
want to add two matrices, what

13
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:25,690
you do is you just add

14
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,420
up the elements of these matrices one at a time.

15
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:30,280
So, my result of adding

16
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:31,460
two matrices is going to

17
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,590
be itself another matrix and

18
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,100
the first element again just by

19
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:36,690
taking one and four and

20
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,660
multiplying them and adding them together, so I get five.

21
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:41,550
The second element I get

22
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,990
by taking two and two

23
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,140
and adding them, so I get

24
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:47,460
four; three plus three

25
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:49,560
plus zero is three, and so on.

26
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:51,400
I'm going to stop changing colors, I guess.

27
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:52,740
And, on the right is open

28
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:56,130
five, ten and two.

29
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,280
And it turns out you can

30
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:00,490
add only two matrices that are of the same dimensions.

31
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,760
So this example is

32
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:06,310
a three by two matrix,

33
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,250
because this has 3

34
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,850
rows and 2 columns, so it's 3 by 2.

35
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,410
This is also a 3

36
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,100
by 2 matrix, and the

37
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:16,300
result of adding these two

38
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,790
matrices is a 3 by 2 matrix again.

39
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,460
So you can only add

40
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:21,810
matrices of the same

41
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,540
dimension, and the result

42
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:24,930
will be another matrix that's of

43
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:28,880
the same dimension as the ones you just added.

44
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:30,740
Where as in contrast, if you

45
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:31,870
were to take these two matrices, so this

46
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,820
one is a 3 by

47
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:36,220
2 matrix, okay, 3 rows, 2 columns.

48
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:39,180
This here is a 2 by 2 matrix.

49
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:41,190
And because these two matrices

50
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,150
are not of the same dimension,

51
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,590
you know, this is an error,

52
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,620
so you cannot add these

53
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,490
two matrices and, you know,

54
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:53,330
their sum is not well-defined.

55
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:55,920
So that's matrix addition.

56
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:58,360
Next, let's talk about multiplying matrices by a scalar number.

57
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,040
And the scalar is just a,

58
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,010
maybe a overly fancy term for,

59
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,750
you know, a number or a real number.

60
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,420
Alright, this means real number.

61
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:10,070
So let's take the number 3 and multiply it by this matrix.

62
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,920
And if you do that, the result is pretty much what you'll expect.

63
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,490
You just take your elements

64
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,090
of the matrix and multiply

65
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,960
them by 3, one at a time.

66
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,380
So, you know, one

67
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:22,160
times three is three.

68
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,780
What, two times three is

69
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,330
six, 3 times 3

70
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,170
is 9, and let's see, I'm

71
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,270
going to stop changing colors again.

72
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,460
Zero times 3 is zero.

73
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:35,930
Three times 5 is 15, and 3 times 1 is three.

74
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,760
And so this matrix is the

75
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:40,480
result of multiplying that matrix on the left by 3.

76
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,150
And you notice, again,

77
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,430
this is a 3 by 2

78
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,880
matrix and the result is

79
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:47,470
a matrix of the same dimension.

80
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,560
This is a 3 by

81
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:49,900
2, both of these are

82
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:53,070
3 by 2 dimensional matrices.

83
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,280
And by the way,

84
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:57,020
you can write multiplication, you know, either way.

85
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,440
So, I have three times this matrix.

86
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,460
I could also have written this

87
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:04,910
matrix and 0, 2, 5, 3, 1, right.

88
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:07,640
I just copied this matrix over to the right.

89
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:11,200
I can also take this matrix and multiply this by three.

90
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:12,050
So whether it's you know, 3

91
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,330
times the matrix or the

92
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,970
matrix times three is

93
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:19,370
the same thing and this thing here in the middle is the result.

94
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,850
You can also take a matrix and divide it by a number.

95
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,320
So, turns out taking

96
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:25,700
this matrix and dividing it by

97
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,300
four, this is actually the

98
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,020
same as taking the number

99
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:33,040
one quarter, and multiplying it by this matrix.

100
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:35,260
4, 0, 6, 3 and

101
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:36,810
so, you can figure

102
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,550
the answer, the result of

103
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,270
this product is, one quarter

104
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,380
times four is one, one quarter times zero is zero.

105
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,580
One quarter times six is,

106
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:49,340
what, three halves, about six over

107
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,280
four is three halves, and

108
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:54,270
one quarter times three is three quarters.

109
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:55,910
And so that's the results

110
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,010
of computing this matrix divided by four.

111
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,900
Vectors give you the result.

112
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,710
Finally, for a slightly

113
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,680
more complicated example, you can

114
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:09,780
also take these operations and combine them together.

115
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:11,420
So in this calculation, I

116
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,780
have three times a vector

117
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:16,340
plus a vector minus another vector divided by three.

118
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:18,300
So just make sure we know where these are, right.

119
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,390
This multiplication.

120
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,670
This is an example of

121
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,920
scalar multiplication because I am taking three and multiplying it.

122
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:30,140
And this is, you know, another

123
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:32,050
scalar multiplication.

124
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,120
Or more like scalar division, I guess.

125
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:36,470
It really just means one zero times this.

126
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,130
And so if we evaluate

127
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:43,280
these two operations first, then

128
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:44,530
what we get is this thing

129
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:47,110
is equal to, let's see,

130
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,010
so three times that vector is three,

131
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:53,390
twelve, six, plus

132
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,060
my vector in the middle which

133
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:58,990
is a 005 minus

134
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:03,730
one, zero, two-thirds, right?

135
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,240
And again, just to make

136
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,010
sure we understand what is going on here,

137
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:11,510
this plus symbol, that is

138
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,670
matrix addition, right?

139
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,930
I really, since these are

140
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:20,130
vectors, remember, vectors are special cases of matrices, right?

141
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,490
This, you can also call

142
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,100
this vector addition This

143
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:27,150
minus sign here, this is

144
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,430
again a matrix subtraction,

145
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,210
but because this is an

146
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,400
n by 1, really a three

147
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:35,490
by one matrix, that this

148
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,480
is actually a vector, so this is

149
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:39,840
also vector, this column.

150
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:43,450
We call this matrix a vector subtraction, as well.

151
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,340
OK?

152
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,100
And finally to wrap this up.

153
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:47,950
This therefore gives me a

154
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,900
vector, whose first element is

155
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:53,470
going to be 3+0-1,

156
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,940
so that's 3-1, which is 2.

157
00:05:55,950 --> 00:06:01,450
The second element is 12+0-0, which is 12.

158
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,890
And the third element

159
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:07,000
of this is, what, 6+5-(2/3),

160
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:10,060
which is 11-(2/3), so

161
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:13,930
that's 10 and one-third

162
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,750
and see, you close this square bracket.

163
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,010
And so this gives me a

164
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:21,660
3 by 1 matrix, which is

165
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:24,060
also just called a 3

166
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:29,020
dimensional vector, which

167
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:33,160
is the outcome of this calculation over here.

168
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:34,950
So that's how you

169
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,660
add and subtract matrices and

170
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:41,050
vectors and multiply them by scalars or by row numbers.

171
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,690
So far I have only talked

172
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,680
about how to multiply matrices and

173
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:46,950
vectors by scalars, by row numbers.

174
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,080
In the next video we will

175
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:49,290
talk about a much more

176
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,920
interesting step, of taking

177
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:54,520
2 matrices and multiplying 2 matrices together.
