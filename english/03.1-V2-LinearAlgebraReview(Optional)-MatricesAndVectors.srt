1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,870
Let's get started with our linear algebra review.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:03,900
In this video I want to

3
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:07,710
tell you what are matrices and what are vectors.

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,010
A matrix is a

5
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,560
rectangular array of numbers

6
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:16,060
written between square brackets.

7
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:17,270
So, for example, here is a

8
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,680
matrix on the right, a left square bracket.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,160
And then, write in a bunch of numbers.

10
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,540
These could be features from

11
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:30,790
a learning problem or it could

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,070
be data from somewhere else, but

13
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,430
the specific values don't matter,

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,670
and then I'm going to close it with another right bracket on the right.

15
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,920
And so that's one matrix.

16
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:44,280
And, here's another example of

17
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:46,800
the matrix, let's write 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

18
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:48,290
So matrix is just another

19
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,680
way for saying, is a

20
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:53,040
2D or a two dimensional array.

21
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,250
And the other piece

22
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,640
of knowledge that we need is

23
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:57,800
that the dimension of the

24
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:59,100
matrix is going to

25
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:01,160
be written as the

26
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:05,470
number of rows times the number of columns in the matrix.

27
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,820
So, concretely, this example

28
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,890
on the left, this

29
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,280
has 1, 2, 3, 4

30
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:14,530
rows and it has 2 columns,

31
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,100
and so this example on the

32
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,630
left is a 4 by

33
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,590
2 matrix -  number of rows by number of columns.

34
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,280
So, four rows, two columns.

35
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:28,320
This one on the right, this matrix has two rows.

36
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:30,030
That's the first row, that's

37
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,080
the second row, and it has three columns.

38
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,060
That's the first column, that's the

39
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:38,600
second column, that's the third

40
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:41,660
column. So, this second

41
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:42,960
matrix we say it is

42
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:45,690
a 2 by 3 matrix.

43
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,730
So we say that the dimension of this matrix is 2 by 3.

44
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,840
Sometimes you also see this

45
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,730
written out, in the case

46
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:54,990
of left, you will see this

47
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,450
written out as R4 by 2

48
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,460
or concretely what people

49
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:00,920
will sometimes say this matrix

50
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,050
is an element of the set R 4 by 2.

51
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,400
So, this thing here, this

52
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:05,780
just means the set of all

53
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,510
matrices that of dimension

54
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,090
4 by 2 and this thing

55
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,870
on the right, sometimes this is

56
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,120
written out as a matrix that is an R 2 by 3.

57
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:16,550
So if you ever see, 2 by 3.

58
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,560
So if you ever see

59
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:18,870
something like this are 4 by

60
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,310
2 or are 2 by 3,

61
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,890
people are just referring to

62
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,330
matrices of a specific dimension.

63
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,580
Next, let's talk about how

64
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,970
to refer to specific elements of the matrix.

65
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,010
And by matrix elements, other than

66
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,350
the matrix I just mean

67
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,190
the entries, so the numbers inside the matrix.

68
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,880
So, in the standard notation,

69
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,280
if A is this

70
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,820
matrix here, then A subscript

71
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,410
IJ is going to refer

72
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,940
to the i, j entry,

73
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,560
meaning the entry in

74
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:51,870
the matrix in the ith row and jth column.

75
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,520
So for example a11 is

76
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:56,210
going to refer to the entry

77
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,590
in the 1st row and

78
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,950
the 1st column, so that's the

79
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,080
first row and the first

80
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,630
column and so a11

81
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,230
is going to be equal to

82
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,410
1402.

83
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,770
Another example, a12

84
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,150
is going to refer to

85
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,650
the entry in the first

86
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:14,280
row and the second

87
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:16,260
column and so A

88
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:20,420
12 is going to be equal to 191.

89
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,420
This come from a quick examples.

90
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,520
Let's see, A, oh let's

91
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:27,340
say A32, is going to refer

92
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:30,030
to the entry in the 3rd

93
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,740
row, and second column,

94
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,460
right, because that's 3 2

95
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:41,480
so that's equal to 1437.

96
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:43,360
And finally, A41

97
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:45,310
is going to refer to

98
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,700
this one right, fourth row,

99
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,510
first column is equal to

100
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:53,760
147 and if,

101
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:54,650
hopefully you won't, but if

102
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,650
you were to write and say

103
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,860
well this A43,

104
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,600
well, that refers to

105
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,220
the fourth row, and the

106
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,840
third column that, you know,

107
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:04,180
this matrix has no third

108
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,630
column so this is undefined,

109
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,820
you know, or you can think of this as an error.

110
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:10,830
There's no such element as

111
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,940
A43, so, you know, you

112
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,610
shouldn't be referring to A43.

113
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,630
So, the matrix

114
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,370
gets you a way of letting

115
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,660
you quickly organize, index and access lots of data.

116
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:24,310
In case I seem to be

117
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,430
tossing up a lot of

118
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,560
concepts, a lot of new notations

119
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:28,130
very rapidly, you don't need

120
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,520
to memorize all of this, but

121
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,690
on the course website where we

122
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,690
have posted the lecture notes,

123
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,640
we also have all of these definitions written down.

124
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,150
So you can always refer back,

125
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,550
you know, either to these slides,

126
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,250
possible coursework, so audible lecture

127
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:44,280
notes if you forget well, A41 was that?

128
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:45,640
Which row, which column was that?

129
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:47,460
Don't worry about memorizing everything now.

130
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,090
You can always refer back to

131
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:52,490
the written materials on the course website, and use that as a reference.

132
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,150
So that's what a matrix is.

133
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,290
Next, let's talk about what is a vector.

134
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,880
A vector turns out to be a special case of a matrix.

135
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:02,060
A vector is a matrix

136
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,730
that has only 1 column so

137
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,840
you have an N x 1

138
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:07,810
matrix, then that's a remember, right?

139
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,180
N is the number of

140
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,860
rows, and 1 here

141
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,700
is the number of columns, so, so

142
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:14,710
matrix with just one column

143
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,690
is what we call a vector.

144
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,300
So here's an example

145
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:20,110
of a vector, with I

146
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,850
guess I have N equals four elements here.

147
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,360
so we also call this

148
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:26,650
thing, another term for

149
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,800
this is a four dmensional

150
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,870
vector, just means that

151
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,790
this is a vector with four

152
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,860
elements, with four numbers in it.

153
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,500
And, just as earlier

154
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,730
for matrices you saw this

155
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,110
notation R3 by 2

156
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,330
to refer to 2 by

157
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,650
3 matrices, for this vector

158
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,490
we are going to refer to this

159
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,630
as a vector in the set R4.

160
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,010
So this R4 means a

161
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:54,980
set of four-dimensional vectors.

162
00:05:56,350 --> 00:06:00,730
Next let's talk about how to refer to the elements of the vector.

163
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,720
We are going to use the notation

164
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,300
yi to refer to

165
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,680
the ith element of the

166
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:08,800
vector y. So if y

167
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:12,040
is this vector, y subscript i is the ith element.

168
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,440
So y1 is the

169
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:16,530
first element,four sixty, y2

170
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:19,680
is equal to the second element,

171
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:21,370
two thirty two -there's the first.

172
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,560
There's the second.

173
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:24,960
Y3 is equal to

174
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,750
315 and so on, and

175
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,640
only y1 through y4 are

176
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:32,930
defined consistency 4-dimensional vector.

177
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,550
Also it turns out that

178
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,310
there are actually 2 conventions

179
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,720
for how to index into a

180
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,550
vector and here they are.

181
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,620
Sometimes, people will use

182
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:44,760
one index and sometimes zero index factors.

183
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:46,080
So this example on the left

184
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:48,170
is a one in that

185
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,640
specter where the element

186
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:53,370
we write is y1, y2, y3, y4.

187
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,860
And this example in the right

188
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,830
is an example of a zero index

189
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,720
factor where we start

190
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:01,510
the indexing of the elements from zero.

191
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,440
So the elements go from a zero up to y three.

192
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:07,370
And this is a bit like the

193
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,930
arrays of some primary languages

194
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,430
where the arrays can either

195
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,130
be indexed starting from one.

196
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,500
The first element of an

197
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,150
array is sometimes a Y1,

198
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,930
this is sequence notation I guess,

199
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:21,250
and sometimes it's zero index

200
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,630
depending on what programming language you use.

201
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,180
So it turns out that in

202
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,110
most of math, the one

203
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,560
index version is more

204
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:30,370
common For a lot

205
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:33,670
of machine learning applications, zero index

206
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,800
vectors gives us a more convenient notation.

207
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:37,960
So what you should usually

208
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:40,620
do is, unless otherwised specified,

209
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:43,670
you should assume we are using one index vectors.

210
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,880
In fact, throughout the rest

211
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:46,760
of these videos on linear algebra

212
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:50,200
review, I will be using one index vectors.

213
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:51,270
But just be aware that

214
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,380
when we are talking about machine learning

215
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,210
applications, sometimes I will

216
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,470
explicitly say when we

217
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,730
need to switch to, when we

218
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:59,010
need to use the zero index

219
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,230
vectors as well.

220
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,930
Finally, by convention, usually

221
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,050
when writing matrices and vectors,

222
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,890
most people will use upper

223
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,990
case to refer to matrices.

224
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,920
So we're going to use

225
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:12,250
capital letters like

226
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,090
A, B, C, you know,

227
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,620
X, to refer to matrices,

228
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,650
and usually we'll use lowercase,

229
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,130
like a, b, x, y,

230
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,050
to refer to either numbers,

231
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:26,140
or just real numbers or scalars or to vectors.

232
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:28,100
This isn't always true but

233
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,450
this is the more common

234
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,930
notation where we use

235
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,010
lower case "Y" for referring

236
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,140
to vector and we usually

237
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:36,960
use upper case to refer to a matrix.

238
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,790
So, you now know what are matrices and vectors.

239
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,490
Next, we'll talk about some

240
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,830
of the things you can do with them
